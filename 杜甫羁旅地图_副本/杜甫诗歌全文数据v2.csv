1,龙门,龙门横野断，驿树出城来。气色皇居近，金银佛寺开。往还时屡改，川水日悠哉。相阅征途上，生涯尽几回。,Longmen,"Longmen, sheared off, stretching across the wilds, 
post-road trees come out from the city walls.
From the look of it an imperial dwelling is near,
silver and gold, Buddhist temples appear.
The seasons have often changed as I passed back and forth, 
but the River's waters just keep going on.
I observe it on the road of my journey-
how often can this happen in a lifetime?"
2,重题郑氏东亭（在新安界）,华亭入翠微，秋日乱清晖。崩石欹山树，清涟曳水衣。紫鳞冲岸跃，苍隼护巢归。向晚寻征路，残云傍马飞。,Another on Zheng's Eastern Pavilion,"The splendid pavilion goes into azure mists,
the autumn sun's clear glow is thrown into disarray. 
A fallen rock leans against a mountain tree,
clear ripples pull sheets of algae.
Lavender scales vault, dashing against shore, 
a blue-gray hawk returns to guard its nest.
Towards evening I seek out the road I must travel
with tattered clouds flying by horse's flank."
3,奉寄河南韦尹丈人,甫敝庐在偃师，承韦公频有访问，故有下句。有客传河尹，逢人问孔融。青囊仍隐逸，章甫尚西东。鼎食分门户，词场继国风。尊荣瞻地绝，疏放忆途穷。浊酒寻陶令，丹砂访葛洪。江湖漂短褐，霜雪满飞蓬。牢落乾坤大，周流道术空。谬惭知蓟子，真怯笑扬雄。盘错神明惧，讴歌德义丰。尸乡余土室，难说祝鸡翁。,"Respectfully Sent to My Senior Wei [Ji], Metropolitan Governor in He'nan","A visitor told me that He'nan's governor
asks after Kong Rong when he meets someone.
""Does he still live aloof in reclusion with his green bag
or is he still going from one place to another with his zhangfu cap?"" 
Dining from cauldrons distinguishes his household's status,
in the field of letters he continues the ""Airs of the Domains."" 
I observe him in an inaccessible place of exalted glory,
while I, careless and rash, recall that man at a dead end. 
I seek out Magistrate Tao for thick ale,
for cinnabar pellets I visit Ge Hong.
My short homespun clothes are tossed on the lakes and rivers,
frost and snow fill my tangled locks.
Lonely in the vastness of Heaven and Earth,
I roam around, bereft of techniques of the Way. 
Unworthy to be taken as Jizi Xun,
I truly fear being laughed at like Yang Xiong.
The very gods fear how well you handle intricate problems, 
your virtue and sense of right abounds in popular songs.
An earthen chamber remains in Shixiang,
but one shouldn't tell of its Old Man who Called Chickens."
4,乐游园歌,乐游古园崒森爽，烟绵碧草萋萋长。公子华筵势最高，秦川对酒平如掌。长生木瓢示真率，更调鞍马狂欢赏。青春波浪芙蓉园，白日雷霆夹城仗。阊阖晴开昳荡荡，曲江翠幕排银榜。拂水低徊舞袖翻，缘云清切歌声上。却忆年年人醉时，只今未醉已先悲。数茎白发那抛得，百罚深杯亦不辞。圣朝亦知贱士丑，一物自荷皇天慈。此身饮罢无归处，独立苍茫自咏诗。,Song of Leyou Park,"The ancient park of Leyou rises up dense and fresh, 
emerald plants stretch on endlessly, growing tall and thick.
For the young gentlemen's splendid feast its position is highest of all, 
facing our ale are Qin's rivers, flat as the palm of a hand.
With ladles of long-life wood we show genuine forthright feelings; 
then further we joke over ""saddled horses,"" and engage in madcap pleasures.
With green spring waves and ripples is Lotus Park;
peals of thunder in daylight, the entourage in the Walled Passageway. 
Heaven's Gates open under clear skies, boundlessly vast,
azure tents by the Twisting River, silver placards in lines. 
Brushing waters, slowly lingering, dancing sleeves soar;
through the clouds, piercingly clear, the sound of singing rises.

I think back on the times that I was drunk year after year, 
nowadays before I get drunk I've already grown sad.
These several strands of hair turned white, how can I get rid of them?
a hundred forfeits of full cups, and still I don't refuse.4
I also know that in this sagely reign a low scholar is repulsive, 
when each single creature in its own right receives the grace of Sovereign Heaven.
Finished drinking, this body of mine has nowhere to go,
I stand alone in a vast expanse chanting a poem to myself."
5,曲江三章章五句（其二）,即事非今亦非古，长歌激越梢林莽，比屋豪华固难数。吾人甘作心似灰，弟侄何伤泪如雨。,Three Stanzas on the Twisting River (each stanza has five lines) II,"What lies before me is not the present nor is it the ancient past, 
my long songs swell up and away, grazing forest and wilds,
buildings roof to roof, splendor and power, indeed beyond reckoning.
As for one like me, I willingly let my heart be like ash, 
why should my nephew suffer with tears like rain for me?"
6,曲江三章章五句（其三）,自断此生休问天，杜曲幸有桑麻田，故将移住南山边。短衣匹马随李广，看射猛虎终残年。,Three Stanzas on the Twisting River (each stanza has five lines) III,"I have made my decision in this life to cease questioning Heaven's will, 
at Duqu I luckily have hemp and mulberry fields,
thus I will move to stay by the edge of South Mountain.
In short robes on a single horse I'll follow Li Guang
and watch him shoot the fierce tiger, living out my remaining years."
7,曲江三章章五句（其一）,曲江萧条秋气高，菱荷枯折随风涛，游子空嗟垂二毛。白石素沙亦相荡，哀鸿独叫求其曹。,Three Stanzas on the Twisting River (each stanza has five lines) I,"Dreary is Twisting River, the autumn air is high,
water-chestnuts and lotuses wither and snap with the wind-blown waves,
the traveler helplessly sighs at gray hair coming on. 
White rocks and pale sands are also swept along,
the mournful swan cries out alone, seeking its own kind."
8,遣兴,骥子好男儿，前年学语时。问知人客姓，诵得老夫诗。世乱怜渠小，家贫仰母慈。鹿门携不遂，雁足系难期。天地军麾满，山河战角悲。傥归免相失，见日敢辞迟。,Expressing What Has Stirred Me ,"Jizi is a fine boy,
last year was when he learned to speak.
He asked the names of our visitors
and was able to recite his old man's poems.
I pity his being so young in the turmoil of the times, 
the household poor, he looks to his mother's love.
I didn't succeed in taking him to Deergate,
and I can't expect something tied to a wild goose's foot.
Heaven and Earth are filled with army signal banners, 
among mountains and rivers battle bugles mourn.
If only I get back and don't lose him,
I wouldn't ever put off the day to see him."
9,月夜,今夜鄜州月，闺中只独看。遥怜小儿女，未解忆长安。香雾云鬟湿，清辉玉臂寒。何时倚虚幌，双照泪痕干。,Moonlit Night,"The moon tonight in Fuzhou
she alone watches from her chamber.
I am moved by my children far off there
who don't yet know to remember Chang'an. 
Fragrant fog, her coils of hair damp,
clear glow, her jade-white arms are cold. 
When will we lean at the empty window,
both shone upon, the tracks of our tears dried?"
10,春望,国破山河在，城春草木深。感时花溅泪，恨别鸟惊心。烽火连三月，家 书抵万金。白头搔更短，浑欲不胜簪。,View in Spring,"The state broken, its mountains and rivers remain, 
the city turns spring, deep with plants and trees. 
Stirred by the time, flowers, sprinkling tears,
hating parting, birds, alarm the heart. 
Beacon fires stretch through three months,
a letter from family worth ten thousand in silver. 
I've scratched my white hair even shorter,
pretty much to the point where it won't hold a hatpin."
11,得家书,去凭游客寄，来为附家书。今日知消息，他乡且旧居。熊儿幸无恙，骥子最怜渠。临老羁孤极，伤时会合疏。二毛趋帐殿，一命侍鸾舆。北阙妖氛满，西郊白露初。凉风新过雁，秋雨欲生鱼。农事空山里，眷言终荷锄。,Getting a Letter from Home,"I counted on a traveler to send one,
coming back, he was entrusted with a letter from home. 
Today I got the news,
that they are living there where they were before.
Luckily there is nothing wrong with Xiong'er, 
but Jizi is the one I dote on most.
Approaching old age, my loneliness in travel is extreme,
pained by these times, the chance to meet is remote. 
With graying hair I scurry in the tent palace, 
appointed, I attend on the phoenix-belled palanquin. 
The north palace towers are filled with demon vapors,
but on the western meadows the white dew begins. 
A cool wind, wild geese newly passing,
with autumn rains fish will be born. 
Farming in those deserted mountains -
in reflection on what has happened, at last I'll shoulder a hoe."
12,得舍弟消息,乱后谁归得，他乡胜故乡。直为心厄苦，久念与存亡。汝书犹在壁，汝妾已辞房。旧犬知愁恨，垂头傍我床。,Getting News of My Younger Brother ,"The wind blows the purple thorn-bush,
its colors darken with the spring yard in evening.
Its flowers fall, leaving the old branches,
the wind turns them, but they have no way to go back. 
This kind letter from my flesh and blood is valued,
we drift here and there, it's hard to meet. 
Still there are tears that form a river,
passing through the heavens, again pouring eastward."
13,述怀一首,去年潼关破，妻子隔绝久。今夏草木长，脱身得西走。麻鞋见天子，衣袖露两肘。朝廷愍生还，亲故伤老丑。涕泪授拾遗，流离主恩厚。柴门虽得去，未忍即开口。寄书问三川，不知家在否。比闻同罹祸，杀戮到鸡狗。山中漏茅屋，谁复依户牖。摧颓苍松根，地冷骨未朽。几人全性命，尽室岂相偶。嶔岑猛虎场，郁结回我首。自寄一封书，今已十月后。反畏消息来，寸心亦何有。汉运初中兴，生平老耽酒。沉思欢会处，恐作穷独叟。,An Account of My Concerns ,"Last year Tong Pass was broken,
I have long been cut off from wife and children.
This summer, as plants and trees grew tall,
I escaped and got to flee west.
In hemp sandals I met the Son of Heaven,
both elbows showed through the sleeves of my clothes. 
The court had sympathy that I had made it alive,
old friends were pained at how old and ugly I had become. 
With tears I received the Reminder's post,
our lord's grace was great for those who fled.
Though I could have gone off to my ramshackle gate,
I could not bring myself to mention it right then.
I sent a letter asking of ftree Rivers,
not knowing whether my family survived.
Since then I heard that all there had suffered calamity,
massacred down to the chickens and dogs.
In the mountains under a leaky thatch roof, 
is there anyone still leaning at the window? 
In the roots of a broken gray-green pine,
the ground is so cold that their bones won't have rotted. 
How many people escaped with their lives? -
how can the entire household be together again? 
Mountainous land, a field for fierce tigers,
my heart knots within, I turn my head. 
Since I sent them a letter,
it has already been more than ten months. 
Now instead I dread that news will come -
what feelings are there in this heart?
The Han's fate now for the first time rises anew, 
all my life I have been a lover of ale.
I yearn deeply for that moment of joyous reunion
and fear becoming a poor and solitary old man."
14,徒步归行,明公壮年值时危，经济实藉英雄姿。国之社稷今若是，武定祸乱非公谁。凤翔千官且饱饭，衣马不复能轻肥。青袍朝士最困者，白头拾遗徒步归。人生交契无老少，论交一作心何必先同调。妻子山中哭向天，须公枥上追风骠。,Returning Home On Foot: A Ballad,"In years of your prime Your Excellency has met with perilous times, 
running the state depends indeed on the qualities of a hero.
Since the dynasty's altars of Earth and Grain are as they are right now,
who but you, sir, by martial measures can quell ruin and rebellion? 
The thousand officials at Fengxiang for now are all well fed,
but no more can their clothes be light and their horses sleek. 
Of the courtiers in gowns of blue, the one in the hardest straits
is this white-haired Reminder going home on foot.

Friendships formed in human life take no account of age,
in considering association why need one put sameness of temper first? 
In the mountains my wife and children weep facing the heavens,
from your stables I need the wind-chasing brown charger."
15,元日寄韦氏妹,近闻韦氏妹，迎在汉钟离。郎伯殊方镇，京华旧国移。春城回北斗，郢树发南枝。不见朝正使，啼痕满面垂。得家书去凭游客寄，来为附家书。今日知消息，他乡且旧居。熊儿幸无恙，骥子最怜渠。临老羁孤极，伤时会合疏。二毛趋帐殿，一命侍鸾舆。北阙妖氛满，西郊白露初。凉风新过雁，秋雨欲生鱼。农事空山里，眷言终荷锄。,"On New Year's Day, To my Sister Married into the Wei's ","I've recently heard that my sister with the Wei's
was received in Hanzhongli.
Her husband is elsewhere with a military command,
the capital has moved from Chang'an.
The city in spring, the North Dipper turns round, 
Ying's trees sprout on their south-facing branches. 
I don't see the New Year's envoys to court,
tracks of tears hang, filling my face."
16,出郭,霜露晚凄凄，高天逐望低。远烟盐井上，斜景雪峰西。故国犹兵马，他乡亦鼓鼙。江城今夜客，还与旧乌啼。,Leaving the Town,"Frost and dew grow chilly late in the day, 
the high skies get lower the farther I gaze. 
Distant smoke is rising over the salt-wells,
sinking daylight from west of snow-capped peaks. 
In my homeland there are still troops and horses, 
in this strange land too, war-drums.
A sojourner in the river city tonight
goes back, crying out with the same old crows."
17,垂老别,四郊未宁静，垂老不得安。子孙阵亡尽，焉用身独完。投杖出门去，同行为辛酸。幸有牙齿存，所悲骨髓干。男儿既介胄，长揖别上官。老妻卧路啼，岁暮衣裳单。孰知是死别，且复伤其寒。此去必不归，还闻劝加餐。土门壁甚坚，杏园度亦难。势异邺城下，纵死时犹宽。人生有离合，岂择衰盛端。忆昔少壮日，迟回竟长叹。万国尽征戍，烽火被冈峦。积尸草木腥，流血川原丹。何乡为乐土，安敢尚盘桓。弃绝蓬室居，塌然摧肺肝。,Parted When Getting Old,"No quiet or calm in the land all around, 
those getting old can find no peace.
Children and grandchildren have all died in the ranks,
why should I survive alone?
I throw down my cane and go out the gate, 
those who go with me feel bitter pain for me. 
Fortunately I have some teeth remaining,
that my frame shrunken and dry is what grieves me. 
When a man puts on the armor and helm,
he gives a deep bow, leaving the chief magistrate. 
My old wife lies weeping on the road,
her clothes too thin for the end of the year. 
I know well that this is parting for good,
yet I still feel pained at how poor she will be. 
Once I go, I will surely never return,
yet I still hear her urging me to eat well.
Earthgate Barrier's walls are quite strong,
it will be hard for them to cross at Apricot Garden.
The situation is different than it was by Ye,
so even though I will die, the time may be delayed.
Human life has its partings and reunions, 
frail old age has not been exempted.
I recall long ago when young and strong,
I linger, looking back, and at last heave long sighs. 
All the domains have gone on campaign,
beacon fires cover the ridges and hills. 
Plants and trees stink from piled corpses,
stream and plain are red with flowing blood. 
What village is a ""happy land?""-
how can I dare still hesitate?
I leave my ramshackle dwelling behind forever,
feeling hopeless, I am broken within."
18,东楼,万里流沙道，西征过北门。但添新战骨，不返旧征魂。楼角凌风迥，城阴带水昏。传声看驿使，送节向河源。,East Tower,"The road to Drifting Sands stretches ten thousand leagues, 
those on western campaigns pass through the north gate. 
It only adds to the bones of recent battles,
it does not bring back the souls of former campaigns. 
The tower corners are remote, rising into winds,
the wall's shadow is dim along the waters. 
Word is passed around to go see the envoy
who carries the standards toward the River's source."
19,发同谷县,贤有不黔突，圣有不煖席。况我饥愚人，焉能尚安宅。始来兹山中，休驾喜地僻。奈何迫物累，一岁四行役。忡忡去绝境，杳杳更远适。停骖龙潭云，回首白崖石。临岐别数子，握手泪再滴。交情无旧深，穷老多惨戚。平生懒拙意，偶值栖遁迹。去住与愿违，仰惭林间翮。,Setting Out from Tonggu County,"There was a worthy man whose chimney never was black, 
there was a sage whose mat was never warm.
More so I, hungry and foolish man,
how can I long be at rest in a house? 
When first I came to these mountains,
I halted my coach, delighting in the remoteness.
I was inevitably driven by entanglements of things
to forced travels four times in one year. 
Careworn, I leave this cut-off land, 
going even farther into faint distances.
I halted my team by Dragon Tarn's clouds,
turned my head at Tiger Slope's rocks.
At the crossroads I parted from several men,
tears fell once again as we clasped hands. 
These friendships were neither old nor deep,
but they were very sad for a poor old man. 
All my life I've been lazy and clumsy,
by chance I found a place to lodge and hide away. 
Going or staying always goes counter to my wish,
I'm put to shame by the wings above in the woods."
20,水会渡,山行有常程，中夜尚未安。微月沒已久，崖傾路何難。大江動我前，洶若溟渤寬。篙師暗理楫，歌笑輕波瀾。霜濃木石滑，風急手足寒。入舟已千憂，陟巘仍萬盤。回眺積水外，始知眾星乾。遠遊令人瘦，衰疾慚加餐。,Converging Waters Crossing,"Mountain journeys have regular stages,
but by midnight we still had not rested.
The crescent moon had long sunken away,
the slope tipped downward, how hard was the road! 
The great river stirred before me,
surging as broad as a dark sea.
A boatman plied his oars unseen,
laughing and singing, making light of the waves. 
The frost was thick, trees and rocks slick,
the wind blew hard, hands and feet cold.
Getting on the boat, I already felt a thousand cares,
now mounting the summit, ten thousand more turnings.
Only when peering back over the massed waters 
did I know that all the stars were dry.
Far traveling makes a person lean,
frail and sick, I really should be eating more."
21,立秋后题,日月不相饶，节序昨夜隔。玄蝉无停号，秋燕已如客。平生独往愿，惆怅年半百。罢官亦由人，何事拘形役。,Written after the Beginning of Autumn,"The days and months show us no leniency, 
last night the seasons in sequence changed. 
Cold cicadas cease not in their cries,
autumn swallows are already like sojourners. 
My lifetime desire, to go off on my own, 
depressed that my years are half a century. 
To quit office still comes from oneself -
why am I trapped in service to my body?"
22,乾元中寓居同谷县作歌七首（其二）,长镵长镵白木柄，我生托子以为命！黄独无苗山雪盛，短衣数挽不掩胫。此时与子空归来，男呻女吟四壁静。呜呼二歌兮歌始放，闾里为我色惆怅！,Songs Written While Residing in Tonggu County in the Qianyuan Reign II,"Long harrow, long harrow, handle of white wood, 
my life is entrusted to you as my destiny.
No sprout from the wild taros, the mountain snows are heavy,
I often tug at my short robe, but it doesn't cover my shins.
At this moment together with you I return home empty-handed, 
my boy moans, the girl groans, the four walls are still.
Alas, I sing my second song, and the song now gets wild,
on our behalf the village looks distressed."

ancient trees are towering, with boughs bending down. 
The tree leaves yellow and fall, the dragon is asleep,
vipers come from the east, swimming in the waters.
I marveled at this in my travels, how could I dare go forth? - 
I drew my sword to cut them in half, but then desisted.
Alas, I sing my sixth song, the thoughts in the song linger on,
on my behalf creek and ravine will bring back the beauty of spring.
"
24,乾元中寓居同谷县作歌七首（其七）,男儿生不成名身已老，三年饥走荒山道。长安卿相多少年，富贵应须致身早。山中儒生旧相识，但话宿昔伤怀抱。呜呼七歌兮悄终曲，仰视皇天白日速！,Songs Written While Residing in Tonggu County in the Qianyuan Reign VII,"Man-child born and achieved no fame, his body is already old, 
for three years hurrying hungry over desolate mountain ways. 
The ministers in Chang'an are mostly younger men,
for wealth and honor one truly must dedicate oneself early. 
Confucians in these mountains are former acquaintances, 
talking only about the past brings pain to my feelings.
Alas, I sing my seventh song, and in silence end the tune,
looking up I see in sovereign Heaven the bright sun speeding."
25,乾元中寓居同谷县作歌七首（其三）,有弟有弟在远方，三人各瘦何人强？生别展转不相见，胡尘暗天道路长。东飞鴐鹅后鹙鸧，安得送我置汝旁！呜呼三歌兮歌三发，汝归何处收兄骨？,Songs Written While Residing in Tonggu County in the Qianyuan Reign III,"I have younger brothers, I have younger brothers in places faraway, 
each of the three has grown gaunt, which of them is strong?
Parted in life, I toss and turn and cannot see them,
Hu dust darkens the heavens, and the road is long. 
A wild goose is flying east, with a bald heron behind,
how could I get them to take me and set me by your side?
Alas, I sing my third song, my songs come forth thrice,
where will you go and how will you gather your elder brother's bones?"
26,乾元中寓居同谷县作歌七首（其四）,有妹有妹在钟离，良人早殁诸孤痴。长淮浪高蛟龙怒，十年不见来何时？扁舟欲往箭满眼，杳杳南国多旌旗。呜呼四歌兮歌四奏，林猿为我啼清昼！,Songs Written While Residing in Tonggu County in the Qianyuan Reign IV,"I have a sister, I have a sister, she is in Zhongli,
her husband perished early, the fatherless children were babes. 
The waves are high on the long Huai, krakens and dragons rage.
for ten years I have not seen her, when will she come? 
I want to go in a tiny boat, but arrows fill my eyes,

Alas, I sing my fourth song, my song performed fourfold,
on my behalf forest gibbons cry out in clear daylight.

cold rain in the whistling winds, the leafless trees are wet.
Ancient walls covered with brown artemesia, the clouds do not break,
the white fox leaps about, the brown fox stands still.

restless at midnight, ten thousand cares gather.
Alas, I sing my fifth song, and the song stretches on long,
the soul is summoned but does not come to return to its native home.

28,乾元中寓居同谷县作歌七首（其一）,有客有客字子美，白头乱发垂过耳。岁拾橡栗随狙公，天寒日暮山谷里。中原无书归不得，手脚冻皴皮肉死。呜呼一歌兮歌已哀，悲风为我从天来！,Songs Written While Residing in Tonggu County in the Qianyuan Reign I,"There is a sojourner, a sojourner, his given name, Zimei, 
a head of tangled white hair hangs down past his ears.
For his harvest he gathers chestnut-oak acorns as the monkey-keeper wills,
the weather, cold at twilight in the mountain valley.
No letters come from the central plain, he cannot get to return, 
hand and feet chapped from frostbite, the skin is dead.
Alas, I sing my first song, the song is already full of lament,
and on my behalf a sad wind comes down from the heavens."

fall on the frontier, the sound of one wild goose.
The dew will be white from this night on,
the moon is as bright as at home.
I have brothers, but all are scattered,
I have no family to ask if they still live. 
I send letters but they never arrive,
even more as warfare has not ceased."

Hu horsemen keep on galloping for five or six years.
Plants and trees withered away as I went beyond Swordgate;
now blocked and cut off by clash of arms I grow old beside the River.
Longing for home, I pace in moonlight and stand in the clear night, 
recalling my brothers, I watch the clouds and doze off in broad daylight.
I've heard that at Heyang there was recently a victory -
may the Minister act quickly and smash You and Yan for me!"

bands of pillagers still run free everywhere.
My family far, the day I sent the letter,
autumn comes, the feelings of being a sojourner.

how can I ever see the two capitals?"

his doings were sometimes quite unrestrained.
When the Duke of Dai was sheriff of Tongquan
how free he was in doing as he pleased! 
But when he ascended to robes of court, 
his upright temper swept sternly ahead.
A towering presence, a rare person revealed,
how can such be measured by ordinary standards? 
He determined his plans after the Shenlong Reign, 
the palace was swiftly made spacious and clear.
In a short time he explained how parents were honored,
under his direction he preserved the trust given him. 
All the court gentlemen looked ashamed,
the royal house was in no way weakened. 
He stands out far above the famous officials,
his portrait shines in the royal gallery. 
In my travels I have found his traces, 
lodge pools were all dug out later.
I admire his decision in handling matters,
looking around as I walk, my tears stream freely.
In a loud voice I intone his ""Jeweled Sword,""
the friendship of our spirits is entrusted to the underworld."
33,通泉驿南去通泉县十五里山水作,溪行衣自湿，亭午气始散。冬温蚊蚋在，人远凫鸭乱。登顿生曾阴，欹倾出高岸。驿楼衰柳侧，县郭轻烟畔。一川何绮丽，尽目穷壮观。山色远寂寞，江光夕滋漫。伤时愧孔父，去国同王粲 。我生苦飘零，所历有嗟叹 。,"Composed in the Landscape, Fifteen Leagues Going South from Tongquan","Post Station to the Tongquan County Seat
Walking along the creek our clothes got wet, 
only at noon did the vapor disperse.
Winter was warm, flies and gnats were still there,
far from people ducks are scattered everywhere. 
Climbing and descending, layers of shadow appeared, 
we came out from the high and slanting bank.
The station building was beside dying willows,
the county seat was at the edge of light mist. 
It was so gorgeous all the way along the river,
I looked as far as I could, enjoying the bold vista to the utmost. 
The far colors of the mountains were still and lonely,
light on the river flooded over at evening.
Confucius puts me to shame in distress for the times, 
I am the same as Wang Can in leaving the capital.
In my life I have suffered being tossed along,
and in what I have passed through, I have sighed."

how can my strength be up to this?
Setting out on the road in starlight
makes one vulnerable to all manner of illnesses.
A low person like me lacks the spirit of the Way, 
in difficult straits I am never independent.
We pack our bags, follow fellow-travelers,
until daybreak we cross rough and perilous ground. 
The cold sun is slow to come out of the fog,
the clear river runs swiftly around the mountain. 
My servant walks without making progress,
my old nag seems as if hobbled.
Beaches and isles gradually appear sparsely scattered, 
the scenery dispels the heavy gloom.
It merely consoles my feelings of admiration,
but in the end these are not my former excursions and parties.
Then by chance my aging face smiles,
such splendid scenes are hard to take in often. 
Vague and vast, the road of Ruan Ji,
and once more I shed Yang Zhu's tears."
35,发阆中,前有毒蛇后猛虎，溪行尽日无村坞。江风萧萧云拂地，山木惨惨天欲雨。女病妻忧归意速，秋花锦石谁复数。别家三月一得书，避地何时免愁苦。,Setting Out from Langzhong,"Ahead there are poisonous serpents, fierce tigers lie behind, 
I go on the stream all day long, no hamlets or villages.
The river wind whistles, clouds brush the ground,
the mountain trees are gloomy, the heavens about to rain.
My daughter is sick, my wife worried, I want to get back in a hurry, 
of autumn flowers and stones like brocade I don't take note this time. 
Three months away from home and only once I got a letter,
when in this place of refuge have I avoided bitter sorrow?"

Seeing only an Old Man Wen in ability to civilize the commons,
how would one know that our Li Guang was never given a fief ? 
My route will pass the Yanyu Rocks, a pair of tangled tresses at the temples;
where the heavens enter the gray waves, a single fishing boat. 
Among war horses when will we ever meet again? -
in the spring breeze I will turn my head on Zhongxuan's tower."

I've always wanted to flee into the natural way. 
I crave ale, love windblown bamboo,
I always site my dwelling with woods and streams.
Meeting war, I came to the rivers of Shu, 
bedridden, I found release by what suited me. 
I began with one acre to build my cottage,
then extended it to a broader plot.
I set to work at the start of the Shangyuan Reign, 
I finished in the Baoying Reign.
Dared I plan for beauty of earth and wood? -
yet I feel that it looks quite sturdy.
Terrace and pavilion follow the high and low places, 
wide open, it faces the clear river.
Although there are companions who know my heart,
can they often share my fishing boat?
The clash of arms has not been put to rest,
how can one get to sing tipsily and sleep?
Dragons have no fixed lair,
the yellow swan rubs the gray heavens.
Have the aims of perfected men since ancient times, 
ever accepted the pull of outer things?
I think on my blunt and clumsy manner,
did I ever recognize the harbingers of my ruin? 
Just then I took my wife in hand and left, 
crossing through the gloom of windblown smoke.
In what I did here was nothing absolutely necessary,
in purity and keeping secluded, I'm ashamed at failing in both. 
I still think on my four little pines,
wild vines will easily strangle them. 
Their frosty bones won't grow very tall,
they will always be pitied by my neighbors."

the roads' hardships go on and on, ever a hanger-on.
The ale done, I think back on what has happened in the past ten years,
heart-breaking, to Mount Li they cleared dust from the road."

orders are strict, matters are handled by the norms.
The outriders enter the jeweled land,
by the parting tent flutter golden cords.
Having lingered in merriment on the southern lanes, 
we also climb deep into this mountain.
We hear clearly the chimes in the treetops,
and, going far, pay respects to monks at clouds' edge. 
For the turning mounts this is no new slope,
what we use to climb are the still familiar vines. 
Our ears are stirred by gusts from grotto openings,
our eyes rest on ice from cold valleys.
Leaving the dust, closed off from carriage ruts, 
we leave behind muggy heat until day's end.
I wish to sit through all the long summer days,
getting frail, to find rest in the Greater Vehicle. 
Lodging on travels, I treasure parties,
in hardships I think on friends.
Burdened with life, how much longer can it last? -
the distress of parting keeps going on as well."

and found Master Wei who shares the same trouble.
The world is filled with the clash of arms,
years and months grow long by the riverside.

a spring day, both our tresses are graying.
Find out for me about the bamboo at southern creek, 
their sprouting tips must have risen over my wall."
42,草堂,昔我去草堂，蛮夷塞成都。今我归草堂，成都适无虞。请陈初乱时，反复乃须臾。大将赴朝廷，群小起异图。中宵斩白马，盟歃气已粗。西取邛南兵，北断剑阁隅。布衣数十人，亦拥专城居。其势不两大，始闻蕃汉殊。西卒却倒戈，贼臣互相诛。焉知肘腋祸，自及枭獍徒。,Thatched Cottage,"When I left my thatched cottage long ago, 
barbarians were filling Chengdu.
Now when I return to my thatched cottage,
it's a time when Chengdu has no worries.
Let me recount when the revolt first occurred: 
things turned upside down in an instant.
The great general had gone off to court,
and a group of underlings raised rebellious plots.
In the middle of the night they cut open a white horse, 
they made a blood-pact, their temper already harsh. 
They gathered troops from Qiongnan in the west
and to the north cut off a corner of the Jian'ge Road.
Several dozen commoners
also crowded to take charge of the city. 
The situation did not admit two chiefs,
then we heard of differences between Chinese and Tibetans. 
The western troops instead turned pikes on each other,
and rebel officials killed one another.
Who would have thought ruin from those most close
would spread on its own to those ""owls and wildcats""? 
Men with a sense of right were pained and enraged 
how political order had succumbed in turmoil.
One domain indeed then had three lords,
and the myriad folk were almost made food for the fish. 
Chiming in together, chastising and rewarding,
no one was willing to distinguish the guiltless. 
Before their eyes were lined up stocks and pillories,
behind their backs reed organs were playing. 
Laughing and chatting, they butchered people, 
and the splashing blood filled the long avenues. 
To this very day where they used the axe
one hears voices cry out in the wind and rain.
The concubines and horses of ghosts 
with sad mien served your pleasures. 
The laws of our dynasty are still in place,
so such things are enough to make one gasp with shock. 
This poor fellow ran away for the while
and for three years gazed toward eastern Wu. 
Bows and arrows darken the river and seas,
it would have been hard to visit the five lakes.
In the end I couldn't bear to abandon this spot 
and came back to cut away the brush and weeds. 
Coming in the gate, the four pines were still here,
I walked in my clogs among ten thousand bamboo, sparsely spread. 
The old dog is happy that I returned,
hanging around me he goes under my robes. 
The neighbor is happy that I returned,
he buys ale and brings it in a gourd.
The great official is happy that I returned, 
he sends riders to ask what I need.
The city is happy that I returned,
visitors block the village.
The world is still not yet at peace,
regular troops are superior to hack scholars. 
Tossed about at the edge of wind-blown dust,
in what place can this old fellow settle peacefully?
In these times I am seen as a wart,
luckily my bones are not yet bare and dry.
Contentment with getting enough to eat shames my last days,
I dare not look for more than eating wild beans."
43,春归,苔径临江竹，茅檐覆地花。别来频甲子，倏忽又春华。倚杖看孤石，倾壶就浅沙。远鸥浮水静，轻燕受风斜。世路虽多梗，吾生亦有涯。此身醒复醉，乘兴即为家。,Return in Spring,"Mossy path, bamboo overlooking the river, 
thatched eaves, flowers that cover the ground. 
Many sixty-day cycles since I left,
now coming back, suddenly spring is in bloom. 
Leaning on a cane, I look at a lone rock,
I go to sandy shallows to drain my jug. 
Far off gulls serene, float on the waters,
light swallows slant, catching the wind.
Though obstacles are many on the roads of the age, 
my life too has its limits.
This body sobers and gets drunk again,
when I follow my whim, that is home."

Personnel Evaluation, no second Xiao He of Han.
Tiny boat, its moorings tied long beside the sands,
southern lands, the drifting clouds many over the water. 
Alone holding a fishing pole at last I will go off far, 
hard to go with the wings of birds to stop by even once.
I know that you do not yet love the colors of spring lakes,
your thrill is in a black colt and its white jade trappings."
45,归雁,东来万里客，乱定几年归。肠断江城雁，高高向北飞。,Returning Wild Geese,"Traveler from the east across thousands of miles, 
the rebellion settled, when will I return?

flying directly north, so high."

now, dandelion puffs tossed along on the horizon.
I cannot tell you how I have rushed here and there,
now by chance we come together in chat and laughter. 
I used to pay attention to the arts of the Way,
you, master, early dispelled my ignorance. 
Every household welcomed a Ji Zixun,
Everywhere, they recognized Lord Pot. 
Whistling long, north of Emei,
going unseen east of Jade Fort Mountain. 
Sometimes you ride a fierce tiger,
in your bare chamber you employ an immortal servant lad.
My hair is so sparse it doesn't need to get white, 
can my aging complexion grow ruddy again?
Gazing on the clouds, I grieve for all my rough going,
at day's end, I admire your mellow contentment. 
Amid turmoil and ruin, I'm still slave to my body, 
bleak isolation, letters do not get through.
Army banners hang at the entrance to key roads,
swords hang from waists in five-league pavilions. 
I will ever be a sojourner in strange places,
an old man in the last years of life.
If you feel sorry for me, my bones can be changed,
and you can also make me ride on the clear wind."
47,暮寒,雾隐平郊树，风含广岸波。沉沉春色静，惨惨暮寒多。戍鼓犹长击，林莺遂不歌。忽思高宴会，朱袖拂云和。,Evening Cold,"Fog hides the trees on the level moor,
wind carries the waves on the distant shore.
All sunken, spring's colors are calm,
dreary, there is much evening cold. 
Garrison drums are still steadily beaten, 
so that orioles in the woods do not sing. 
I suddenly think on a noble banquet,
red sleeves brushing the zither of Mount Yunhe."
48,破船,平生江海心，宿昔具扁舟。岂惟青溪上，日傍柴门游。苍皇避乱兵，缅邈怀旧丘。邻人亦已非，野竹独修修。船舷不重扣，埋没已经秋。仰看西飞翼，下愧东逝流。故者或可掘，新者亦易求。所悲数奔窜，白屋难久留。,Broken Boat,"All my life, a heart set on the river and lakes, 
long ago I made ready a small boat.
It wasn't only for roaming on the blue creek
daily staying close to my ramshackle gate.
When in panic I fled the rebellious troops
from far off I thought of this, my former home. 
Even my neighbor now is gone,
the wild bamboo alone are tall.
No more will I rap time on its gunwales, 
it has already been buried a full autumn.
I look up and watch the wings flying west,
below, I'm put to shame by the stream going east. 
Perhaps I could dig out the old one,
and a new one is easy to find.
What bothers me is running away to hide so often,
that in this plain cottage I can't stay long."
49,双燕,旅食惊双燕，衔泥入此堂。应同避燥湿，且复过炎凉。养子风尘际，来时道路长。今秋天地在，吾亦离殊方。,A Pair of Swallows,"Lodging on my journey I was startled by a pair of swallows, 
mud in beaks, entering this hall.
They must be fleeing the world's vicissitudes like me,
and also passing through situations too hot and too cold.
They raise their young in the windblown dust,
the road was long to come here.
This autumn heaven and earth will remain,
and I too will leave this strange land."
50,水槛,苍江多风飙，云雨昼夜飞。茅轩驾巨浪，焉得不低垂。游子久在外，门户无人持。高岸尚如谷，何伤浮柱欹。扶颠有劝诫，恐贻识者嗤。既殊大厦倾，可以一木支。临川视万里，何必阑槛为。人生感故物，慷慨有馀悲。,Deck by the Water,"Winds often gust hard on the gray river, 
rain and clouds fly day and night.
This thatched porch mounted over mighty waves -
how could it help sagging down low? 
Long did the owner roam abroad - 
there was no one to maintain the place. 
If even high slopes turn to valleys,
why care that these posts in the water are leaning? 
A precept tells us ""Support what totters"":
I suspect I'll be laughed at by those who know. 
Yet this differs from a mighty hall's collapse	
it can be propped up by just a single beam.
You can see thousands of miles from the riverside - 
what need is there for a porch?
But people are moved by familiar things,
and I am overwhelmed with grief."
51,送舍弟频赴齐州三首,岷岭南蛮北，徐关东海西。此行何日到，送汝万行啼。绝域惟高枕，清风独杖藜。危时暂相见，衰白意都迷。风尘暗不开，汝去几时来？兄弟分离苦，形容老病催。江通一柱观，日落望乡台。客意长东北，齐州安在哉！诸姑今海畔，两弟亦山东。去傍干戈觅，来看道路通。短衣防战地，匹马逐秋风。莫作俱流落，长瞻碣石鸿。,Seeing Off My Brother Ying On His Way to Qizhou I II III,"Min's peak lies north of the southern Mon, 
Xu Pass lies just west of the Eastern Sea.
What day will you reach there on your journey? -
I see you off with ten thousand strands of tears.
In a remote region I only rest aloof from things, 
in the clear breeze I lean on my cane alone.
In times of peril we saw each other a brief while, 
aging, white-haired, our minds both in a daze.  

Dust in the wind darkens without clearing away, 
you go off, but when will you come again?
For brothers separation is bitter,
age and illness hasten the change in my looks. 
The river passes through to One Pillar Pavilion, 
the sun sets on Gazing Homeward Terrace.
My sojourner's thoughts will be ever in the northeast:
where indeed is Qizhou? 

All our aunts now live by the sea,
two of our brothers live East of the Mountains. 
You go off to find them near the clash of arms,
coming back, look to see if the roads are passable.
Short robes, a place where they defend embattled land, 
a single horse moving with autumn's wind.
Let us not both drift about, down and out,
I will ever spy for the swan from Jie Rock."
52,宿府,清秋幕府井梧寒，独宿江城蜡炬残。永夜角声悲自语，中天月色好谁看。风尘荏苒音书绝，关塞萧条行路难。已忍伶俜十年事，强移栖息一枝安。,Staying Overnight at Headquarters ,"Clear autumn at headquarters, the tung tree by the well is cold, 
I spend the night alone in this river city, the wax torch dying.
Through the long night the sound of the horn sadly speaks to itself,
the color of the moon mid-sky is quite fine - but who looks at it? 
The dust of armies goes on and on, all news is cut off, 
in the dreariness of barrier passes, hard traveling.
I have put up with rootless wandering, it's been this way ten years,
I make myself move to take a roost on one secure branch."
53,游子,巴蜀愁谁语，吴门兴杳然。九江春草外，三峡暮帆前。厌就成都卜，休为吏部眠。蓬莱如可到，衰白问群仙。,Traveler,"To whom can I tell my sadness in Ba and Shu? - 
my elation for Wumen is faint in the distance.
Nine Rivers lie out beyond the spring plants,
the Three Gorges, ahead of my twilight sail.
I am weary making divinations in Chengdu, 
let me cease the sleep of Bi Zhuo.
If ever I can reach Penglai,
in white-haired decline, I'll pay respects to the immortals."

I'm ashamed that this body is swept here and there.
It had nothing to with despising ribbons and cap,
it was just to avoid the dust of war.
Once I left you that night on Seven Star Bridge, 
thrice the Dipper's Handle has shifted to spring. 
His defeat was not as at Red Cliff,
I fled because of the Yellow Turbans.
How free and easy you were when you left,
but my hiding was different from that of a recluse. 
I finished a letter, but no geese were passing,
my clothes grew old with patches and tatters. 
I often packed my bags in fright,
I frequently lay sick as I drifted alone.
Dawn orioles were expert at making tears gush,
the autumn moon understood how to wound my soul. 
Those I meet exclaim how my face has darkened, 
biting back gloom, I tell of my sufferings.
Jieyu has come back into Chu,
and Wang Can will not return to Qin.
In Brocade City my cinnabar stove is left,
I found my fishing line at Washing-Flower Creek. 
With diabetes I can only pity myself.
getting up late, what close friend can I seek?
I have heard of the Zhou Archivist, crouching by the pillar, 
there was a Han officer who rode a raft.
Not easy to trifle with phoenix or swan,
nor proper to tame dragon or tiger.
The wayfarer arrives, having hung up his cap,
our association is not new, the carriage awning-tipping kind. 
Our temperaments have always coincided,
we each prefer the genuineness of the other's nature.
In my aimless goings, I am indifferent whether I live or die, 
I have no mind to be ashamed at my poverty.
By chance my sugar cane and taros have survived,
and fortunately we can each face pine and bamboo. 
Coarse meals are as in days before,
but I'm shocked at the poverty and misery of the present times.
My daughter has grown up, sure-handed in making homespun clothes,
my boy is big now, he rolls the scrolls up evenly. 
At Pengkou the river is like white satin,
the snow of Silkworm Slope resembles silver. 
Famous gardens face azure pinnacles,
rustic oars sink into green water-clover.
I am often delighted that such a princely residence 
repeatedly invites this man of the river and sea.
In your company I don't notice it getting late,
in your sincere warmth, ten days are suddenly past.
If only the numinous mushroom and orchid are flourishing, 
why care whether our roofs and beams are neighboring? 
There is no common creature at Shanyang,
Zheng's welcome lodge now detains a guest.
We come in and go out on horseback side by side, 
in splendor we join the ""treasures of the feast mat."" 
Again we visit the temple to the First Ruler,
then go on to pass through the postern of the ""little city.""
The Stone Mirror communicates with a hidden soul, 
the Zither Terrace hides those crimson lips.
She who was sent on her final journey is only dirt and dung,
she with whom he fell in love is just brambles and brush. 
We set out ale under the tall trees of a grove,
we watch chess on the shores of deep waters.
An insignificant person, I am willing to have calloused feet,
but I can rest these belabored sinews just a bit. 
Clustered in the net, round golden carp are stuck, 
we boil the fine water-shield with abundant fibers. 
With long songs we tap on a willow's gall,
we lean on a wisteria wreath for a nap.
In the farming months you must oversee tasks - 
dare the field-hands fail to do their utmost?
Hard to go without food in this life adrift,
we cherish the clear morning for a fine meeting. 
All the domains are darkened by the clash of arms, 
our present king's lessons of virtue are pure.
I'd like to hear that we are rid of the monsters -
cease painting portraits in Unicorn Gallery.
My eyes, washed clear, look on careless, unfeeling ways, 
empty of concern whether I am successful or not.
Let us not in the world of friends that stick together like glue
have men value only Lei and Chen forever."
55,至后,冬至至后日初长，远在剑南思洛阳。青袍白马有何意，金谷铜驼非故乡。梅花欲开不自觉，棣萼一别永相望。愁极本凭诗遣兴，诗成吟咏转凄凉。,After the Solstice,"After the winter solstice has arrived the days begin to get longer, 
far off in Jiannan, I am longing for Luoyang.
A blue robe and white horse, what do they matter to me? --
they are not my home, with its Golden Valley and the bronze camels. 
The plum blossoms are about to open, but I don't notice them,
for once parted from the sugarplum calyx I am ever gazing. 
At sorrow's height I always rely on poems to vent my mood,
when a poem is done and I chant it, I get even more gloomy."
56,自阆州领妻子却赴蜀山行三首,汩汩避群盗，悠悠经十年。不成向南国，复作游西川。物役水虚照，魂伤山寂然。我生无倚着，尽室畏途边。长林偃风色，回复意犹迷。衫裛翠微润，马衔青草嘶。栈悬斜避石，桥断却寻溪。何日干戈尽，飘飘愧老妻。行色递隐见，人烟时有无。仆夫穿竹语，稚子入云呼。转石惊魑魅，抨弓落狖鼯。真供一笑乐，似欲慰穷途。,From Langzhou Taking My Wife and Children Back to Shu; Traveling in the Mountains I II III,"Rushing headlong, we fled the rebels, 
going on and on, we passed ten years.
I didn't accomplish setting off toward southern lands,
now again we make our journey to West River.
Servant to material things, water's insubstantial reflection; 
soul wounded, the mountains lonely and still.
My life has no place to rest securely,
the whole family by the perilous road.

Tall forests, bent low in the wind,
turning this way and that, still can't tell where we are. 
Vests moist, wet by azure mist,
the horse neighs with green plants in its mouth. 
Plank walkway, bending aside to avoid the rock,
bridge broken, we go back to find a crossing over the creek. 
When will the clash of arms be done? -
tossed along, I am shamed before my wife.

Appearance of travelers alternately hidden and appearing, 
smoke of habitation is sometimes there, sometimes not. 
My servant talks as he winds through bamboo,
my boy goes off into the clouds and shouts. 
Rocks set rolling startle goblins,
twanging bow fells monkey and flying squirrel. 
Truly these provide us a moment of mirth,
as if wanting to console us a bit in the hardships of travel."
57,别常徵君,儿扶犹杖策，卧病一秋强。白发少新洗，寒衣宽总长。故人忧见及，此别泪相忘。各逐萍流转，来书细作行。,"Parting from Chang, Summoned Gentleman ","My son supports me, still leaning on my cane,
I've been bedridden for more than the whole autumn.
My white hair seems thin when newly washed,
my winter clothes are too large and long. 
My old friend has worried about me,
at this parting, we gaze on each other in tears.
Each of us will turn in the current with the duckweed,
when you send a letter, make the lines small."
58,别房太尉墓阆州,他乡复行役，驻马别孤坟。近泪无干土，空山有断云。对棋陪谢傅，把剑觅徐君。唯见林花落，莺啼送客闻。,"Taking Leave of the Grave of Defender-in-Chief Fang
","Again enforced travel in a strange land,
I halt my horse and take leave of his lonely tomb.
From recent tears there is no dry earth,
lowering in the sky there are broken clouds. 
Facing the go-board, in the company of tutor Xie; 
taking sword in hand, I seek the lord of Xu.
I see only the flowers falling in the woods,
orioles cry out, heard sending the traveler on his way."
59,春远,肃肃花絮晚，菲菲红素轻。日长唯鸟雀，春远独柴荆。数有关中乱，何曾剑外清。故乡归不得，地入亚夫营。,Spring Goes Far Away,"In the stillness the willow flower floss grows late, 
a sifting flurry, red and white toss lightly.
As days lengthen, just the sparrows,
spring goes far away, only my ramshackle house. 
Often there is fighting Within-the-Passes,
and when was Jianwai ever peaceful?
I cannot get to return to my homeland,
the place is now in Yafu's camp."
60,怀锦水居止二首（其二),层轩皆面水，老树饱经霜。雪岭界天白，锦城曛日黄。惜哉形胜地，回首一茫茫。,"
Thinking Back on My Lodgings by the Brocade River II","A cottage south of the Thousand League Bridge, 
an estate north of Hundred Flowers Pool.
High balconies all face the waters,
old trees are sturdy from living through the frost. 
Snow Ridges, white edging the heavens,
Brocade City, yellow in fading sunlight. 
Alas, this place of splendid scenes -
I turn my head and it is utterly a blur."
61,怀锦水居止二首（其一),军旅西征僻，风尘战伐多。独闻蜀父老，不忘舜讴歌。天险终难立，柴门岂重过？朝朝巫峡水，远逗锦江波。,"
Thinking Back on My Lodgings by the Brocade River I","The army marches west to remote places,
amid wind-blown dust, there is much fighting. 
I have heard that still the elders of Shu
have not forgotten the songs of our Shun.
A natural fastness, but hard at last to hold, 
never again will I pass my ramshackle gate. 
Every morning the waters in the Wu Gorges
draw the waves of Brocade River from afar."
62,旅夜书怀,细草微风岸，危樯独夜舟。星垂平野阔，月涌大江流。名岂文章著，官应老病休。飘零何所似？天外一沙鸥。,Writing of My Feelings Traveling by Night,"Thin plants, a shore with faint breeze, 
looming mast, lone night boat.
Stars suspended over the expanse of the wild plain,
the moon surges as the great river flows on.
My name will never be known from my writings, 
aging and sick, I should quit my post.
Wind-tossed, what is my likeness? -
between Heaven and Earth, a single sandgull."
63,宿青溪驿奉怀张员外十五兄之绪,漾舟千山内，日入泊枉渚。我生本飘飘，今复在何许。石根青枫林，猿鸟聚俦侣。月明游子静，畏虎不得语。中夜怀友朋，乾坤此深阻。浩荡前后间，佳期付荆楚。,Late Clearing,"Sunlight cast back, slanting, now breaks through everywhere, 
the floating clouds thin, not yet going back.
River rainbow, bright, drinks from the river afar,
rain in the gorges, a remainder still falling.
At last ducks and wild geese go off high above, 
and I sense that the bears are getting fat.
Autumn equinox, the traveler is still here,
dew on bamboo, ever so faint in the evening."
64,白帝,白帝城中云出门，白帝城下雨翻盆。高江急峡雷霆斗，古木苍藤日月昏。戎马不如归马逸，千家今有百家存。哀哀寡妇诛求尽，恸哭秋原何处村。,White Emperor,"In White Emperor Castle clouds come out the gates,
below White Emperor Castle the rain is as if from an overturned basin. 
The high river runs fast through the gorges, peals of thunder contend,
azure trees and gray vines, sun and moon are made murky.
The war horse is not so free from restraint as the horse returning home, 
of a thousand households now there are a hundred households surviving.
Wailing lament, a widow, taxed until nothing is left,
weeps piteously on the autumn plain in a village somewhere."
65,第五弟丰独在江左近三四载寂无消息觅使寄此二首（其二）,闻汝依山寺，杭州定越州。风尘淹别日，江汉失清秋。影著啼猿树，魂飘结蜃楼。明年下春水，东尽白云游。,"
My Fifth Younger Brother Du Feng Is Alone in Jiangzuo: In the Past Three or Four years I've Had No News of Him, and I Seek out a Messenger to Send These Two Poems II","I have heard you are staying in a mountain temple, 
if not Hangzhou, then certainly Yuezhou.
War's dust has lengthened the days of our parting,
at Yangzi and Han I waste another clear autumn. 
My shadow cleaves to trees where the gibbons howl, 
but my soul wafts where ocean mirages form.
Next year when the spring waters come down,
I'll seek you in white clouds where the east ends."

lodging on travels, it is hard to see you.
The plants turn yellow, the fine steed is sick,
day grows late on the sands, the wagtails cold. 
Here in Chu is set the fastness of a barrier fort, 
Wu swallows the breadth of watery precincts. 
Ten years of tears from dawn to evening,
robe and sleeves, never dry."
67,返照,楚王宫北正黄昏，白帝城西过雨痕。返照入江翻石壁，归云拥树失山村。衰年肺病唯高枕，绝塞愁时早闭门。不可久留豺虎乱，南方实有未招魂。,Sunlight Cast Back,"North of the Chu king's palace, it is just now turning dusk, 
west of White Emperor Castle the traces of passing rain.
Sunlight cast back enters the river, rolling the cliffs of stone,
returning clouds hug the trees, I lose sight of the mountain village. 
In my years of infirmity, sick in the lungs, I can only rest aloof,
on this farthest frontier, worried by the times, I long ago shut my gate.
I cannot long remain where wild dogs and tigers run wild -
in the south there truly is an unsummoned soul."
68,寄岑嘉州州据蜀江外,不见故人十年余，不道故人无素书。愿逢颜色关塞远，岂意出守江城居。外江三峡且相接，斗酒新诗终日疏。谢朓每篇堪讽诵，冯唐已老听吹嘘。泊船秋夜经春草，伏枕青枫限玉除。眼前所寄选何物，赠子云安双鲤鱼。,Sent to Cen of Jiazhou,"I haven't seen my old friend for more than ten years, 
I can't bear that my old friend has never sent a letter.
I wished to meet him face to face, the frontier passes too far,
I never expected he would come out to govern and live in a river city.
The outer river and the Three Gorges are connected to one another, 
yet a measure of ale and new poems are still remote.
Every piece by our Xie Tiao deserves to be chanted out loud,
Feng Tang is already too old, so recommend me as you please.
I moored my boat on an autumn night, now I pass through the plants of spring,
bedridden among green maples, cut off from the steps of jade. 
What object from before my eyes will I send you? -
from Yun'an I present to you a pair of carp."
69,寄常徵君,白水青山空复春，徵君晚节傍风尘。楚妃堂上色殊众，海鹤阶前鸣向人。万事纠纷犹绝粒，一官羁绊实藏身。开州入夏知凉冷，不似云安毒热新。,"Sent to Chang, Summoned Gentleman","White waters and green mountains, it is spring again in vain,
the Summoned Gentleman's later days are passed near the dust of war. 
A Chu consort in the hall, her beauty different from others,
an ocean crane by the steps sings out facing people.
Ten thousand problems all jumbled, and still no grain to eat, 
bound to a single post, yet, in fact, hiding away.
When summer comes to Kaizhou, you can feel coolness,
not like here at Yun'an with its poisonous heat renewed."
70,客居,客居所居堂，前江后山根。下堑万寻岸，苍涛郁飞翻。葱青众木梢，邪竖杂石痕。子规昼夜啼，壮士敛精魂。峡开四千里，水合数百源。人虎相半居，相伤终两存。蜀麻久不来，吴盐拥荆门。西南失大将，商旅自星奔。今又降元戎，已闻动行轩。舟子候利涉，亦凭节制尊。,Lodging As a Sojourner,"The hall where I lodge, lodging as a sojourner,
has the river in front and the mountain's base behind. 
Down into this gulch, a ten-thousand-foot slope,
where gray waves swell, crashing over. 
All the treetops are a luxuriant green,
slanting and straight, cracks on rock mixed together. 
The cuckoo cries there day and night,
and the bold man's soul shrinks back.
The gorges open for four thousand leagues,
as the waters bring together several hundred streams. 
Half inhabited by men, half by tigers,
they harm each other but at last both survive. 
Hemp from Shu has long not come,
and Wu's salt is held up at Jingmen. 
The southwest lost its chief general,
and merchants fled like shooting stars.
Recently another commander has been sent down, 
I have heard that his great coach has set out.
The boatmen will wait until it is advantageous to venture,
this too depends on respect for his command.
I am in the middle of my journey,
I can't get to consider making a living. 
I lie in sorrow, my sick feet useless,
or walk slowly to look at the small garden.
The short patch is bordered by emerald grasses, 
I gaze deeply troubled, longing for the Prince. 
The phoenix has gone off, along with his mate,
sparrows in the hedge make a dense racket at dusk. 
Observing these things, I imagine my homeland, 
for ten years I've left my tumble-down village.
At sunset how many wings return to rest? -
dusk comes in vain to the northern woods 
How can I get to turn over the eight dark seas 
and wash clean the universe for my lord?
If Hou Ji and Qi found the effort easy
how would the Dog Rong be worth overwhelming? 
A man of learning, aging, without achievements,
servant of the throne, worrying about the frontiers all around. 
In my trunk I have an old brush,
when the feeling takes me, I sometimes pick it up again."
71,客堂,忆昨离少城，而今异楚蜀。舍舟复深山，窅窕一林麓。栖泊云安县，消中内相毒。旧疾甘载来，衰年得无足。死为殊方鬼，头白免短促。老马终望云，南雁意在北。别家长儿女，欲起惭筋力。客堂序节改，具物对羁束。石暄蕨芽紫，渚秀芦笋绿。巴莺纷未稀，徼麦早向熟。,Sojourner's Hall,"I recall a while ago I left the ""little city,""
and now I'm as far from it as Chu from Shu. 
I left my boat and again deep mountains,
faint and remote, a patch of forested foothills. 
I moored and lodged in Yun'an county,
but my diabetes was poisoning me inside. 
This old sickness has gone on twenty years,
reaching years of decline, have I not had enough? 
Though I'll die and become a ghost in a strange land, 
my hair white, I have avoided a short lifespan.
The old horse gazes at last on clouds,
wild goose in the south, its mind in the north.
Since leaving home, my sons and daughters have grown, 
I want to rise, but am ashamed by sinews' strength.
The seasons change in a sojourner's hall,
all things face me, caught in travels.
Rock sun-warmed, the fern-shoots purple, 
isles splendid, the reed sprouts green.
Ba's orioles are everywhere, not yet few,
frontier wheat is getting ripe early. 
Going on afar, the sun stirs on the river, 
silently spring bids farewell to the trees.
They select outstanding talent for Gentlemen of the Secretariat,
considering myself, I have already reached the peak.
Men of great fame of earlier generations
have perished and were buried, achieving nothing.
It strangely turned out that I wear the cords and badge of office,
yet my endowed nature has always been secluded and solitary. 
Wherever I have rested during my life
I have always planted a couple of stands of bamboo. 
My accumulated legacy, just some thick brew,
my managing and building, only a thatched cottage.
One of the great lords of state recalled me,
he frequently wrote to the throne to provide me with a meager salary. 
The ruler worries, but how can I save the age? -
I am far away, and ever more lapsed from my office.
Practice civil virtues, and court plans will be correct;
explain why something is right, and heaven's avenues will be straight. 
Yet still I imagine scurrying through the court,
in some tiny way to aid the Altars of Earth and Grain.
But with my body as it is now
in advancing or retiring, I leave myself just to travel."
72,立春,春日春盘细生菜，忽忆两京梅发时。盘出高门行白玉，菜传纤手送青丝。巫峡寒江那对眼，杜陵远客不胜悲。此身未知归定处，呼儿觅纸一题诗。,Beginning of Spring,"For spring's first day, ""spring plates"" with slender shoots,
at once I recall the two capitals, the time when plums come out. 
Plates went forth from noble gates bringing that white jade,
the foods were carried by dainty hands bringing threads of green.
The Wu Gorges, the cold river - how can I bear to face them? 
The far wayfarer from Duling feels unbearable sorrow.
Since this body does not know where to go to rest,
I call to the lad to find paper and I write a poem."
73,秋风二首（其二）,秋风淅淅吹我衣，东流之外西日微。天清小城捣练急，石古细路行人稀。不知明月为谁好，早晚孤帆他夜归。会将白发倚庭树，故园池台今是非。,Autumn Wind II,"The autumn wind whistles, blowing on my robes,
out beyond the eastward current the sun grows faint in the west.
Sky clear, a small city, the silk is pounded urgently,
rock ancient, a narrow path, travelers are few.
I know not for whose sake the bright moon is so fine, 
sooner or later my lone sail will head off some night.
May the day come when with white hair I rest by the trees in my yard,
pool and terrace of my garden at home, are they the way they were or not?"
74,秋风二首（其一）,秋风淅淅吹巫山，上牢下牢修水关。吴樯楚柂牵百丈，暖向神都寒未还。要路何日罢长戟，战自青羌连百蛮。中巴不曾消息好，暝传戍鼓长云间。,Autumn Wind I,"The autumn wind whistles blowing on Wu Mountain,
at Upper Lao and Lower Lao they've set up river barriers.
Wu masts and Chu rudders pulled by hundred-yard tow-ropes,
in warm weather they headed to Chengdu, in cold weather they've not yet returned.
On the key roads what day ever are long pikes put away? -
fighting goes from the dark-robed Qiang all the way to the southern Mon.
Never once from middle Ba is the news good,
darkness carries sounds of garrison drums among the white clouds.

a lone city by White Emperor Castle.
Tossed about, hundred leagues farther on,
diabetic for already three years now.
The male sword cries out in the open case, 
a collection of books fills my moored boat.
Separated by turmoil, the heart does not unfold,
wasting away, daily more dreary.
Wife and children are concerned for my sinews' strength, 
but the years and months have sent off my prime.
Climbing for a view, there are many fine things,
for fashioning my spirit, I rely on my poems. 
The gorges constrain the gray river rising,
the cliffs array round tree-canopies among rocks. 
The latter brush the clouds, buried in Chu vapor;
the river goes to the sea, pressing hard on Wu skies. 
Boiling well-water makes salt quickly;
they cross to remote places to burn off fields.
At times I am amazed by the layers of precipices,
where can one find level land? 
Tufted ducks dance in pairs, 
apes hang in clusters.
Emerald vines, dangling long like sashes,
brocade stones, as small as coins. 
Never do spring plants die,
cold-weather flowers too are adorable. 
Hunters fan up the encampment fires,
a wilderness inn draws from a mountain spring. 
I was called awake, scratching my head urgently,
how many clogs have I worn out, walking with my cane?
In the two capitals I still have some meager resources, 
but abroad in the world close friends are gone. 
When headquarters first called me to service,
I was fortunate to fill the ranks as a Vice-Director. 
In the season for melons I am still a sojourner,
I suffer going on incessantly like a duckweed adrift. 
Medicines, strewn about, to no effect,
but the autumn wind spreads some comfort and ease. 
It opens gown's folds, drives off malarial haze,
sweeps away clouds and mist and makes the eyes see clearly.
A grand feast, ceremonies of the nobility,
the fair women stand before the important guest. 
The mournful zither saddens this aged man
in the splendid chamber, with gorgeous immortals.
It is a Kaiyuan melody from the Southern Palace
in ordinary times passed on by members of the Troupe. 
A dharma song, the notes shifting and changing,
and all the guests were shedding tears.
I lament my lone shadow in far-off Kuizhou, 
my twisting gut seared by thoughts of Duqu. 
Now the waters of Dragonstable
everywhere bear the stench of the Dog Tribes. 
Geng and Jia supported the royal house,
Xiao and Cao bow to the imperial seat.
Using our might, they eliminated scorpions and wasps,
joining forces, they emulated hawk and falcon.
What we had before is still here, intimidating and stern, 
but those wicked men have never repented their evils. 
The dynasty needs to carry out assaults,
but people think fondly on stopping pike and javelin. 
That slave knew nothing of ceremony,
an abundance of grace wrongly gave him authority. 
Once the Hu star came with a comet-flare,
then the common folk were caught fast.
An imperial decree was moving, filled with sorrow and pain, 
complex and troubling laws were abolished.
The legacy established, the first kingship was set forth,
rejoicing at the omens, he went forth on a hunt.
In the forbidden precincts the strands of governance were secret, 
on the Three Terraces aid and support were complete.
As for a bear, he took back L眉 Wang,
""Swan and Wild Goose"" praised King Xuan.
Indirectly I've listened to word about our ruler of the Restoration 
I always chant of his unprecedented worthies.
Excellent news from One-Pillar [Lodge] comes often,
the leagues of road to Xialao are a thousand.
Zheng and Li are glorious in contemporary opinion, 
both are ahead of me in literary composition.
Yin Keng and He Xun, still clear and concise,
Shen Quanqi and Song Zhiwen are suddenly continued. 
Their pitch-pipes compare to Kunlun bamboo,
from their tones can be known the dryness or wetness of strings. 
In panache, they both have great worth,
suiting what is appropriate, they have long forgotten the fishtrap. 
Zheng is always thus in establishing guest-lodges,
as for rising to dragon status, indeed there is such a Li here. 
Although I am prevented from paying them due respects,
I dare not let the opportunity to associate with them slip from me. 
For one excellent discernment gathers the model of men,
for the other an unperturbed mind savors the Way's mysteries. 
Horses reach one, all sweating blood,
for the other cranes screech, ever those of Qingtian.
Supporting wings arose from Mount Shang, 
Penglai connected to the towers of Han. 
Guan Ning's gauze hat is pure,
Director Jiang's brocade gown is fresh.
In that eastern commandery Li sometimes writes poems on walls, 
by Southern Lake Zheng daily raps the sides of the boat.
In far excursions they cross to remote realms
and excellent lines dye their splendid note-paper. 
I always want to go flying off alone to them,
but I am helplessly dragged down by a hundred cares. 
My life is already dreary and bleak,
and the dynasty's fate is facing hard times.
My quilt and pillow have fully sunken in weeds, 
my pond has been left to ruin.
Separations beset me with worries,
at summer and winter festivals, my tears stream.
Dewy chrysanthemums glow in Feng and Hao,
autumn vegetables cast reflections in the Jian and Chan. 
With whom can I discuss past matters? -
in how many places have paths newly been formed? 
I look back in vain to honor and wealth,
in the noise and contention I don't care to whip on my horse. 
Weapons and pikes, the dust billowing,
Yangzi and Han, the moon charming.
In frustration I watch the autumn swallows, 
in the bleakness listen to autumn cicadas.
I have received your remembrance of my ""insect carving,""
carp-case letters enquired after my bedridden state.
For divination I envy Junping's cane, 
robbed, I still have Zijing's quilt.
Purse empty, I take bracelets and hairpins,
rice gone, I snap ornaments from hatpins. 
The orange tree shades with its cool leaves, 
a thatched study of eight or nine beams.
The Eight Formations, on the shore north of the sands,
the city wharf, on the ridge west of the inlet.
Bound by duty away from home, my heart always felt crushed, 
but staying on here, my sickness at once improved.
Purple gathered, Min ridge taros;
white planted, Lu pool lotuses.
When their colors are best, pears are redder than cheeks, 
when their flesh is fullest, chestnuts bigger than fists.
Edict to the kitchen: just one dish,
to get to eat my fill, sometimes I eat three eels.
My son goes off to watch the fish weir, 
someone comes astride a horse blanket. 
Tied up scrapwood, my gate so narrow,
a stream of water trickles through bamboo pipes.
A ditch reaches the ""ridge"" of the public fields,
a village lies by the empty land of a wilderness shrine. 
Hole in my hedge, I take briars to fend off intrusion,
fallen rock, I use rattan to wrap it.
Let me ask: can frequent visits to court 
compare to peacefully sleeping in daylight?
Who says that my progress falls short of others? -
I realize that I can be secure right where I sit.
In foggy rains the silver seal loses its luster,
with its fragrance, the whitewashed office has charms. 
Purple phoenixes have no care for the distance,
let the brown sparrow just flit about here.
I had to struggle in my studies and failed to follow the crowd, 
each of these excellent gentlemen endeavored at it.
The splendor of their repute supports the Pole Star,
sooner or later they will reach the star orbit.
Kuang Heng will be retained for his earnest remonstrance, 
Fu Qian will be recommended by Confucian scholars.
If they do nothing more than practicing their blunt directness,
the chance will come to right the potter's wheel.
Dressing in dark, not eating until night, cares and worries abundant, 
for common folk, distress and bitterness team together.
Their portraits will be there all the day long on Cloud Terrace,
for whom else would green-slip histories be compiled? 
What hardship is there in traveling? -
my excitement focused on a quest. 
Long before I readied oars that fly,
soon I intend to draw the twanging string.
I have vowed myself to that temple by Double Peak, 
as disciple I'll seek Chan's Seventh Patriarch.
I'll lower my sail to pursue my past,
robed in homespun I'll go toward the Truth.
Anshi's was of great fame in the Jin, 
for King Zhao clients headed to Yan. 
On the road I will be no Ruan Ji,
on my raft, I will resemble Zhang Qian. 
Brushed aside, how can clouds still remain? - 
lingering here, the daylight will not extend.
When the wind comes, I'll finally break through the waves,
water monsters will not drool at me.
Some day to come, I'll take leave of the Goddess, 
I dread the cuckoo feeling springtime pain.
Serene friendship will have meetings and partings as they may,
I will roam about circling the watery lands.
I basically adhere to K膩shyapa,
when did I ever rely on Woquan?
Lushan's peaks appear in the blink of an eye,
the tangerines and well are still out of reach.
Rushing east put the crane returning home in desperate straits, 
campaigning south, everywhere kites falling from the sky.
Late I have learned of that doctrine of many subtleties,
at last I will follow it to block former transgressions. 
Where Gu Kaizhi's polychrome painting is arrayed, 
Dh奴ta Temple, where the jadelike stele is carved. 
All kinds of incense from deep in the darkness,
how many places solemn and burgeoning?
With courageous resolve for mind's ultimate state, 
pure and frail, let my body be feeble.
The golden scalpel shaved my eyeballs in vain,
I have never left the measure of images in a mirror."
76,秋兴八首（其八）,昆吾御宿自逶迤，紫阁峰阴入渼陂。香稻啄馀鹦鹉粒，碧梧栖老凤凰枝。佳人拾翠春相问，仙侣同舟晚更移。彩笔昔游干气象，白头吟望苦低垂。,Stirred by Autumn VIII,"At Kunwu Hill the Yusu Brook winds around and away,
where the shadow of Purple Towers crest falls into Lake Meipi.
Sweet-smelling rice, pecked the last, for parrots, the grains
sapphire tung trees, perch of old, the phoenixs branches.
Fair maidens gathered kingfisher plumes, as gentle gifts in spring, 
sharing a boat, undying companions moved further on that evening. 
My colored brush in former outings ventured upon the atmosphere,
now white-haired, I sing and gaze, head hanging in bitterness."
77,秋兴八首（其二）,夔府孤城落日斜，每依北斗望京华。听猿实下三声泪，奉使虚随八月查。画省香炉违伏枕，山楼粉堞隐悲笳。请看石上藤萝月，已映洲前芦荻花。,Stirred by Autumn II,"On Kuizhous lonely walls setting sunlight slants,
then always I trust the North Dipper to lead my gaze to the capital. 
Listening to gibbons I really shed tears at their third cry,
accepting my mission I pointlessly follow the eighth-month raft.
The censer in the ministry with portraits eludes the pillow where I lie, 
hill towers white-plastered battlements hide the sad reed pipes.
Just look there at the moon, in wisteria on the rock,
it has already cast its light by sandbars on flowers of the reeds."
78,秋兴八首（其六）,瞿唐峡口曲江头，万里风烟接素秋。花萼夹城通御气，芙蓉小苑入边愁。朱帘绣柱围黄鹤，锦缆牙樯起白鸥。回首可怜歌舞地，秦中自古帝王州。,Stirred by Autumn VI,"From the mouth of the Qutang Gorge to the Twisting Rivers side, 
thousands of miles of wind-blown fog connect pale autumn. 
Through the walled passage to Calyx Manor the royal aura passed,
and into tiny Lotus Park the frontiers sorrows entered. 
Beaded hangings and sculpted pillars surrounded brown swans, 
from brocade cables and ivory mast rose a white gull.
The head turns with pity and love for those places of song and the dance:
Qin since ancient times has been land of emperors."
79,秋兴八首（其四）,闻道长安似弈棋，百年世事不胜悲。王侯第宅皆新主，文武衣冠异昔时。直北关山金鼓振，征西车马羽书迟。鱼龙寂寞秋江冷，故国平居有所思。,Stirred by Autumn IV,"I have heard tell that in Changan its like playing chess,
a hundred-year span, the worlds troubles, grief beyond enduring. 
Mansions of counts and princes all have new masters,
those in civil and army uniforms differ from olden times.
Straight north past fortified mountains kettledrums are thundering 
from wagon and horse on western campaigns winged dispatches rush. 
Fish and dragons grow silent now, autumn rivers grow cold,
the life I used to have at home is the longing in my heart."
80,秋兴八首（其五）,蓬莱宫阙对南山，承露金茎霄汉间。西望瑶池降王母，东来紫气满函关。云移雉尾开宫扇，日绕龙鳞识圣颜。一卧沧江惊岁晚，几回青琐照朝班。,Stirred by Autumn V,"Palace towers of Penglai stand facing South Mountain,
the metal stalk that catches the dew is high in the Milky Way. 
Gazing west to Onyx Pool the Queen Mother is descending,
from the east come purple vapors and fill Han Pass. 
Pheasant tails shift in clouds, palace fans open 
sunlight circles dragon scales, I see the Emperors face.
By the gray river I lay once and woke, alarmed that the year had grown late -
how often did I, by the gates blue rings, take my humble place in dawn courts ranks?"
81,秋兴八首（其一）,玉露凋伤枫树林，巫山巫峡气萧森。江间波浪兼天涌，塞上风云接地阴。丛菊两开他日泪，孤舟一系故园心。寒衣处处催刀尺，白帝城高急暮砧。,Stirred by Autumn I,"Jade-white dew withers and harms forests of maple trees,
on Wu Mountain and in Wu Gorges, the atmosphere, bleak and dreary. 
Between rivers margins the waves churn level with sky,
wind-driven clouds over passes touching earth in shadow. 
Chrysanthemum clumps twice have bloomed forth tears of another day, 
a lonely boat tied up once and for all a heart set on its homeland. 
Everywhere clothes for cold weather hasten ruler and blade,
walls of White Emperor Castle high, pounding blocks urgent in dusk."
82,热三首（其二）,瘴云终不灭，泸水复西来。闭户人高卧，归林鸟却回。峡中都似火，江上只空雷。想见阴宫雪，风门飒踏开。,"
Heat II","Miasmal clouds never disappear, 
the Lu River comes from the west.
People close their doors and just lie down,
birds turn back to the forest. 
Everywhere in the gorges is like fire, 
and over the river, only useless thunder.
I imagine seeing the snow of the palace ice-house,
its breezy gates swinging briskly open."
83,热三首（其三）,朱李沉不冷，雕菰炊屡新。将衰骨尽痛，被褐味空频。歘翕炎蒸景，飘飖征戍人。十年可解甲，为尔一沾巾。,"
Heat III","The red plum, immersed, does not get cold, 
zizania seeds are often freshly cooked. 
Getting frail, my bones all hurt,
suffering sunstroke, the flavors change frequently in vain. 
Very quick is this scene of steamy heat,
long swept along, the soldiers on campaign. 
Only after ten years can you take off your armor,
for you I soak my kerchief."
84,热三首（其一）,雷霆空霹雳，云雨竟虚无。炎赫衣流汗，低垂气不苏。乞为寒水玉，愿作冷秋菰。何似儿童岁，风凉出舞雩。,"
Heat I","In vain the thunder peals and rumbles,
in the end there is nothing of clouds and rain. 
Blazing and fiery, clothes stream with sweat,
the head hangs low, the breath does not revive. 
I beg to be jade in cold water,
I wish to become a chill autumn zizania.
How can this compare to my childhood years,
the wind cool as I came out on the rain altars?"
85,宿江边阁,暝色延山径，高斋次水门。薄云岩际宿，孤月浪中翻。鹳鹤追飞静，豺狼得食喧。不眠忧战伐，无力正乾坤。,Spending the Night in a Pavilion by the River,"The colors of darkness extend on the mountain paths, 
in a high study I lodge by the river gate.
Filmy clouds spend the night on cliff 's edge,
the lone moon heaves over in the waves.
Cranes and storks serene, flying after one another, 
wolves and wild dogs howl, getting their prey.
I do not sleep from worry over battles -
I lack the strength to right the universe."
86,峡中览物,曾为掾吏趋三辅，忆在潼关诗兴多。巫峡忽如瞻华岳，蜀江犹似见黄河。舟中得病移衾枕，洞口经春长薜萝。形胜有余风土恶，几时回首一高歌。,Observing Things in the Gorges,"I once was a local clerk, busy in the Three Core Regions,
I recall that at Tong Pass I had much inspiration for poems.
The Wu Gorges suddenly seem as though looking on Mount Hua,
just as the Yangzi in Shu resembled seeing the Yellow River. 
I grew sick in my boat, moved my pillow and quilt,
at this cavern mouth I spend the spring as the hanging moss grows long.
The scenery is amply splendid, but the climate bad,
when will I turn my head and sing out loud?"

in the entourage at a new reign's beginning.
A rebel aura offended the temporary capital,
stars of witchery descended on lodgings for attendance. 
The six dragons peered from afar toward the Han palace, 
ten thousand riders toured Yao Waste.
The Northland saw the return of Heaven's Pace,
our holy capital remembered the imperial carriage.
No sooner did horses sweat in one campaign 
than the common folk avoided becoming fish. 
On the registry, with a coiling dragon seal,
we were shoulder to shoulder lining the phoenix palanquin. 
What happened differed from the greeting at Dai Lodge, 
your joy was unlike the reward of Zhuxu.
Then the rebels returned to allegiance,
Heaven and Earth were getting peaceful and calm. 
Untalented, I joined with you in repairing the dragon robes, 
receiving a summons, I was permitted to tug the robe-hems. 
Among egret ranks I was unworthy of the cloud towers,
you, the unicorn, lingered on the jade stairs.
The poet of Wen's Park, after much sickness; 
the Courtier, his former friends estranged. 
Tossed along, mournful, I meet you,
with abundance of thoughts on how it used to be. 
Windblown mist, Wu Gorges stretch far,
Chu palace's terraces and kiosks are gone.
What strikes my eyes here does not make for discussing old times,
but your new writings still ""rouse me."" 
Clear autumn withers the emerald willows, 
on parting's shores fall the red lotus.
There is news of many battle-flags,
what I have been through brings sighs for my home village. 
Battles in succession, domains that are as lips to teeth, 
army emergencies, the feathered dispatches speed.
At headquarters he repeatedly asked you for plans,
at your mountain home you were then hoeing medicinal herbs. 
A ""Terrace Star"" went to court to pay respects,
from the Commissioner there was a recommendation. 
In western Shu disaster will be put to rest for a long time,
this old man in the south, for the first time relaxes his fury. 
Responding to the emperor, tell him to reduce troops 
greed wastes the supplies in storehouses.
The situation depends on the necessary use of soldiers,
but accomplishment is wanting, and ritual is overlooked.
An imperial saddle, a gilded charger, 
a palace inkstone, a jade toad.
As you dance obeisance, silver hooks descend,
imperial grace in waves, a brocade horse-blanket unfurls. 
This trip will not be without help to the country,
but closeness to my good friend will be in the past.
I look fondly on your countenance with the departing oars,
I fancy your speed along the river.
Overcome by illness, too weary to draw water or hull rice, 
hard-pressed, like wood-gatherers or fishermen.
I trouble my fine guest begging for rice,
I copy poems heeding minor officials. 
The evening sunlight slants on Duling, 
the Jue's waters lined by cold mud.
Don't tell of the hair of one by these clear creeks
that white-streaked locks shine against the comb."
88,中宵,西阁百寻余，中宵步绮疏。飞星过水白，落月动沙虚。择木知幽鸟，潜波想巨鱼。亲朋满天地，兵甲少来书。,The Middle of Night,"West tower, more than a hundred yards high, 
in the middle of night I pace its grillwork. 
Shooting stars, white passing the waters,
setting moonlight, formless stirring on stands.
I know of the hidden bird, carefully choosing its branch, 
I imagine the huge fish, sunken under the waves.
Friends and kin fill the whole world.
yet in the warfare few letters come."
89,子规,峡里云安，江楼翼瓦齐。两边山木合，终日子规啼。眇眇春风见，萧萧夜色凄。客愁那听此，故傍旅人低。,Cuckoo,"Yun'an county in the Gorges,
mansion by the river, its winglike tiles even. 
On both sides the mountain trees merge,
and all day the cuckoo cries.
Far and faint, heard in spring breeze, 
dreary in the gloomy colors of night.
How can the sojourner, with his sorrows, listen to this?	
on purpose near to me it sings softly."
90,八月十五夜月二首（其二）,稍下巫山峡，犹衔白帝城。气沉全浦暗，轮仄半楼明。刁斗皆催晓，蟾蜍且自倾。张弓倚残魄，不独汉家营。,"
Moon on the Night of the Fifteenth of the Eighth Month II","It gradually lowers in the Wu Mountain gorge, 
still holding White Emperor Castle in its light. 
Sunken in vapor, the whole shore is dark,
as the orb slants, half the tower is bright. 
Watch-kettles all hurry the morning along, 
and the Toad tips downward on its own.
Stretching a bow depending on fading moonlight
was not only in the camp of the House of Han."
91,八月十五夜月二首（其一）,满目飞明镜，归心折大刀。转蓬行地远，攀桂仰天高。水路疑霜雪，林栖见羽毛。此时瞻白兔，直欲数秋毫。,Moon on the Night of the Fifteenth of the Eighth Month I,"That bright mirror flies, filling my eyes, 
homesick heart, a broken great sword.
Tossed dandelion puff, the places it goes are far,
having pulled on the cassia branch, I look up to the heavens' height.
The water route seems like frost and snow,
I can see feathers and down at roost in the woods. 
At this moment I look on the white Hare,
and can virtually count its autumn hairs."
92,别李秘书始兴寺所居,不见秘书心若失，及见秘书失心疾。安为动主理信然，我独觉子神充实。重闻西方止观经，老身古寺风泠泠。妻儿待我且归去，他日杖藜来细听。,Parting From Li of the Palace Library Where He is Staying in Shixing Temple,"Not seeing the Librarian my heart feels lost, 
getting to see the Librarian I lose heart's torment.
Stillness governs action, that principle is true indeed,
I alone am aware that you have achieved a fullness of spirit.

Again I hear you recite that Western Sutra of Cessation,
for my old body, an ancient temple where the breeze is cool.
My wife and children await my coming, I'll go back now for a while,
someday, leaning on my staff, I'll come to listen in detail."
93,登高,风急天高猿啸哀，渚清沙白鸟飞回。无边落木萧萧下，不尽长江滚滚来。万里悲秋常作客，百年多病独登台。艰难苦恨繁霜鬓，潦倒新停浊酒杯。,Climbing the Heights,"The wind blows hard, the heavens, high, gibbons howl in lament,
isles clear, sands white, where birds turn in flight.
Endless trees shed their leaves that descend in the whistling wind,
unending, the long River comes on churning.
Grieving for fall across ten thousand leagues, always a traveler,
often sick in this century of life I climb the terrace alone.
In hardship I bitterly resent these tangled, frost-white locks,
down and out, I recently quit cups of thick ale."
94,东屯月夜,抱疾漂萍老，防边旧谷屯。春农亲异俗，岁月在衡门。青女霜枫重，黄牛峡水喧。泥留虎斗迹，月挂客愁村。乔木澄稀影，轻云倚细根。数惊闻雀噪，暂睡想猿蹲。日转东方白，风来北斗昏。天寒不成寝，无梦寄归魂。,Moonlit Night at East Camp,"Sick old man, duckweed swept along,
defending frontiers, a former grain-producing camp. 
In spring farming I grow fond of the strange ways here,
months and years pass right at my barred gate. 
The Blue Maid, frosty maples heavy,
waters of Yellow Ox Gorge are noisy. 
Mud retains the tracks of tigers fighting,
the moon hangs above this village of a sojourner's sadness. 
Sparse shadows of tall trees show clearly,
light clouds rest along their small roots. 
Often startled hearing the sparrows' ruckus,
sleeping a while, I imagine the gibbons crouching. 
The sun turns, the east grows white,
a breeze comes, and the Northern Dipper fades. 
The weather so cold I cannot get to sound sleep,
dreamless, there is a soul longing to go home."
95,虎牙行,秋风歘吸吹南国，天地惨惨无颜色。洞庭扬波江汉回，虎牙铜柱皆倾侧。巫峡阴岑朔漠气，峰峦窈窕溪谷黑。杜鹃不来猿狖寒，山鬼幽阴雪霜逼。楚老长嗟忆炎瘴，三尺角弓两斛力。壁立石城横塞起，金错旌竿满云直。渔阳突骑猎青丘，犬戎锁甲围丹极。八荒十年防盗贼，征戍诛求寡妻哭，远客中宵泪沾臆。,Ballad of Tigertooth,"The autumn wind in a whish blows on the southern domains, 
Heaven and Earth are dreary and lack all color.
Waves rise on Lake Dongting, Yangzi and Han swirl,
Tigertooth and Bronze Column both lean over.
The Wu Gorge's shadowy summits have northern desert atmosphere, 
peaks and ridges hidden away, stream gulches and valleys black.
The cuckoo does not come, apes and gibbons are cold,
the mountain wraith secluded in misery, hard-pressed by frost and snow.
Old men of Chu give long sighs recalling miasmal heat,
a horn bow three feet long needs two stones of weight to pull. 
On the cliff stands a stone castle, rising athwart the frontier,
flag-staffs with golden inlay rise straight up filling the clouds. 
The cataphracts from Yuyang bagged Green Hill as their game, 
the chain mail of the Dog Rong was heard at the red ridgepole. 
A decade in the encircling wastes defending against marauders,
far garrisons and tax demands, widowed wives weep, 
a far traveler at midnight soaks his chest with tears."
96,江梅,梅蕊腊前破，梅花年后多。绝知春意好，最奈客愁何。雪树元同色，江风亦自波。故园不可见，巫岫郁嵯峨。,River Plum,"
The plum buds break open before the La festival,
even more plum blossoms come after the year changes. 
I know full well that spring's intentions are good,
but most of all, I can't help a sojourner's sadness. 
The snow-like trees are essentially the same color, 
the river wind here too raises waves.
But I cannot see the gardens of home -
Mount Wu's peaks swell up towering."
97,入宅三首（其二）,乱后居难定， 春归客未还。 水生鱼复浦， 云暖麝香山。 半顶梳头白， 过眉拄杖斑。 相看多使者， 一一问函关。,"
Moving Into My Cottage II","After the Rebellion my lodgings have never been fixed, 
spring is back, but the traveler not yet returning.
Waters rise on Yufu Shore,
clouds darken Musk Mountain.
On half my scalp my combed hair is white, 
passing my brows, the cane I lean on is mottled. 
Those I see include many sent on missions --
of each and every one I ask about Han Pass."
98,入宅三首（其三）,宋玉归州宅，云通白帝城。吾人淹老病，旅食岂才名。峡口风常急，江流气不平。只应与儿子，飘转任浮生。,Moving Into My Cottage III,"Song Yu's dwelling in Guizhou,
its clouds reach all the way to White Emperor Castle. 
I myself linger here, aging and sick,
a wayfarer's meals, but hardly with Song's talent and fame. 
At the mouth of the gorges the wind always blows hard, 
the river flows on, vapors never at peace.
All I should do is go with my sons,
swept along, giving myself to this life adrift."
99,入宅三首（其一）,奔峭背赤甲，断崖当白盐。客居愧迁次，春酒渐多添。花亚欲移竹，鸟窥新卷帘。衰年不敢恨，胜概欲相兼。,"
Moving Into My Cottage I","Looming up sharply, Red Shell at my back; 
facing White Salt Cliff, a sheared-off slope.
A wayfarer's lodging, ashamed to be changing place,
spring's colors gradually increase.
Flowers press upon bamboo to be transplanted, 
birds peer in past newly rolled up curtains.
I dare not resent my declining years -
this magnificent view will be together with me."
100,上白帝城二首（其二）,白帝空祠庙，孤云自往来。江山城宛转，栋宇客徘徊。勇略今何在，当年亦壮哉！后人将酒肉，虚殿日尘埃。谷鸟鸣还过，林花落又开。多惭病无力，骑马入青苔。,"
Climbing White Emperor Castle II","An empty shrine to the White Emperor 
where lone clouds come and go of themselves. 
River and mountains, the walls bend round; 
beam and roof, here the traveler lingers. 
Where now are those daring stratagems? - 
back then he was bold indeed!
Men in aftertimes brought meat and ale,
but the deserted hall grows ever more dusty. 
Birds from the valley still pass by singing, 
flowers in the groves fall and bloom again.
Much ashamed that I have no strength in my sickness,
I ride my horse onto the green moss."
101,上白帝城二首（其一）,江城含变态，一上一回新。天欲今朝雨，山归万古春。英雄余事业，衰迈久风尘。取醉他乡客，相逢故国人。兵戈犹拥蜀，赋敛强输秦。不是烦形胜，深惭畏损神。,"
Climbing White Emperor Castle I","The River city offers changing forms, 
each time I climb the walls it is new.
The heavens are ready to rain this morning,
the mountains send away an eternal spring. 
The lingering achievements of heroes,
I waste away, too long in the windblown dust. 
Getting drunk here, a traveler from another land,
I meet someone from my homeland. 
Arms still press around upon Shu, 
taxes are forcibly shipped to Qin.
It is not that I find this splendid scene wearisome,
but I fear lest deep shame harm my spirit."
102,巫山县汾州唐使君十八弟宴别兼诸公携酒乐相送率题小诗留于屋壁,卧病巴东久，今年强作归。故人犹远谪，兹日倍多违。接宴身兼杖，听歌泪满衣。诸公不相弃，拥别借光辉。,"At Wu Mountain County Governor Tang of Fenzhou Holds a Parting Banquet, and Various Gentlemen Bring Ale and Musicians to See Me Off; I Dashed Off This Little Poem and Left It On the Wall","Long I lay ill in eastern Ba,
now I force myself to return home.
My old friend is still banished here far away,
this day increasing my sense that things have gone often awry. 
Attending the banquet, body together with cane,
listening to the songs, tears fill my robes. 
These gentlemen have not abandoned me,
surrounding me at parting, I borrow their illustriousness."
103,登岳阳楼,昔闻洞庭水，今上岳阳楼。吴楚东南坼，乾坤日夜浮。亲朋无一字，老病有孤舟。戎马关山北，凭轩涕泗流。, Climbing Yueyang Tower,"I heard long ago of Dongting's waters, 
and this day I climb Yueyang Tower.
Wu and Chu split apart in the southeast,
Heaven and Earth float day and night. 
From kin and friends not a single word, 
old and sick, I do have a solitary boat. 
War-horses north of barrier mountains,
I lean on the railing, my tears streaming down."
104,登舟将适汉阳,春宅弃汝去，秋帆催客归。庭蔬尚在眼，浦浪已吹衣。生理飘荡拙，有心迟暮违。中原戎马盛，远道素书稀。塞雁与时集，樯乌终岁飞。鹿门自此往，永息汉阴机。,Getting On a Boat to Go Off to Hanyang,"I abandon you, my spring abode, and go off- 
the autumn sail hastens the wayfarer's return. 
The vegetables in the yard are still in my eyes,
as waves by the shore already blow on my robes. 
In making a living, tossed about, inept;
my heart has a goal, in twilight years gone awry. 
On the central plain warhorses abound,
letters come seldom across the distant roads. 
Frontier geese gather with the season,
the crow weathervane on the mast flies all year long. 
From here on I will go to Deergate
forever putting to rest the motives at Hanyin."
105,地隅,江汉山重阻，风云地一隅。年年非故物，处处是穷途。丧乱秦公子，悲凉楚大夫。平生心已折，行路日荒芜。,The Corner of the Earth,"At Yangzi and Han, blocked by mountains in layers, 
wind and clouds, a corner of the earth.
From year to year, no familiar thing,
wherever I go, that is road's end.
In death and destruction, Qin's young noble; 
grieving and cold, Chu's grand master.
My heart as it used to be has already broken,
and the road I travel gets daily more choked with weeds."
106,发刘郎浦,挂帆早发刘郎浦，疾风飒飒昏亭午。舟中无日不沙尘，岸上空村尽豺虎。十日北风风未回，客行岁晚晚相催。白头厌伴渔人宿，黄帽青鞋归去来。,Setting Out From Master Liu's Shore,"We set the sail and started early from Master Liu's Shore, 
the swift winds were whistling, darkening the noon.
In the boat not a day goes by but there is dust and sand,
deserted villages on the shore all with jackals and tigers.

For ten days the north wind has blown, and the wind has not yet shifted,
the traveler goes on late in the year, and the lateness hurries him on.
White-haired, I am weary of spending the night a companion of fishermen,
with yellow hat and green footwear let me go home!"
107,泛江,方舟不用楫，极目总无波。长日容杯酒，深江净绮罗。乱离还奏乐，飘泊且听歌。故国流清渭，如今花正多。,Adrift on the River,"My double boat uses no oars,
as far as I can see, no waves anywhere. 
The long days have room for a cup of ale,
the deep River, figured satins clear.
In war and parting music is still performed, 
as I drift about, I listen to singing a while. 
My homeland is where the clear Wei flows,
where nowadays the flowers are at their fullest."
108,更题,只应踏初雪，骑马发荆州。直怕巫山雨，真伤白帝秋。群公苍玉佩，天子翠云裘。同舍晨趋侍，胡为淹此留。, Another on the Same,"I'm sure I'll tread through the first snows
when I ride my horse, setting forth from Jingzhou.
I fear the rains of Wu Mountain, 
and am truly pained by autumn of White Emperor Castle. 
Gray pendants of jade on all the lords,
the Son of Heaven's cape of kingfisher cloud.
Those of the same bureau rush to serve in morning,
so why am I lingering here?"
109,归雁,闻道今春雁，南归自广州。见花辞涨海，避雪到罗浮。是物关兵气，何时免客愁。年年霜露隔，不过五湖秋。,"Wild Geese Returning in Migration
","I've heard tell that this spring's wild geese,
make their southern return from Guangzhou. 
Seeing flowers they leave the South China Sea,
fleeing the snow, they reached Mount Luofu. 
These creatures are bound with war's weather, 
when will they ever escape the wayfarer's sorrows? 
Every year beyond the frost and dew
they did not get past the Five Lakes in autumn."
110,江汉,江汉思归客，乾坤一腐儒。片云天共远，永夜月同孤。落日心犹壮，秋风病欲疏。古来存老马，不必取长途。,Yangzi and Han,"At Yangzi and Han, a traveler longing to go home, 
between Earth and Heaven, one Confucian hack. 
A puff of cloud, Heaven shares such distance;
the long night, moon the same in solitude. 
In the setting sun, the heart still vigorous, 
in autumn wind, sickness almost cured.
From ancient days, when taking care of old horses,
one has not made them take to the long road."
111,久客,羁旅知交态，淹留见俗情。衰颜聊自哂，小吏最相轻。去国哀王粲，伤时哭贾生。狐狸何足道，豺虎正纵横。,Long a Wayfarer,"From my travels I understand how friends are treated, 
in lingering on, I have seen the ordinary sentiments. 
With aging looks I mock myself a while,
minor clerks treat me with utmost contempt. 
Leaving the capital made Wang Can lament; 
pain at the times brought Jia Yi to weep.
But the foxes aren't even worth mentioning
since tigers and jackals run rampant."
112,山馆,南国昼多雾，北风天正寒。路危行木杪，身远樊云端。山鬼吹灯灭，厨人语夜阑。鸡鸣问前馆，世乱敢求安。,A Mountain Inn,"In southern lands, much fog in broad daylight, 
a north wind, the weather now is cold.
the road is steep, I walk among treetops,
my person remote, I spend the night at clouds' edge. 
Mountain goblins blow out my lamp,
people in the kitchen talk as night ends. 
When the cock crows, I ask of the inn ahead,
dare I seek security in troubled times?"
113,水宿遣兴奉呈群公,鲁钝仍多病，逢迎远复迷。耳聋须画字，发短不胜篦。泽国虽勤雨，炎天竟浅泥。小江还积浪，弱缆且长堤。归路非关北，行舟却向西。暮年漂泊恨，今夕乱离啼。童稚频书札，盘餐讵糁藜。我行何到此，物理直难齐。高枕翻星月，严城叠鼓鞞。风号闻虎豹，水宿伴凫鹥。异县惊虚往，同人惜解携。蹉跎长泛鹢，展转屡鸣鸡。嶷嶷瑚琏器，阴阴桃李蹊。余波期救涸，费日苦轻赍。支策门阑邃，肩舆羽翮低。自伤甘贱役，谁愍强幽栖。巨海能无钓，浮云亦有梯。勋庸思树立，语默可端倪。赠粟囷应指，登桥柱必题。丹心老未折，时访武陵溪。,Expressing What Stirred Me while Spending the Night on the Water: Respectfully Presented to Various Gentlemen,"Stupid and dull, still often sick,
in social exchanges, erring because of distance.
Gone deaf, I have to have characters written out,
my hair so thin it can't take a comb.
Though this watery land works hard at raining,
in the end this hot summer weather leaves but shallow mud. 
The little rivers still have high waves,
I tie my pliant mooring for the while on the long embankment. 
This road is not the one back to north of the passes,
my boat instead goes toward the west.
In my twilight years, the bitterness of being swept along,
this evening, weeping from war and separation.
My children often write urgent letters,
not having even gruel with goosefoot for dinner. 
How did I come to this point? -
the pattern of things is really hard to regard with equanimity. 
I rest apart, stars and moon toss in the waves,
city under curfew, the repeated rolling of drums. 
In wind's howling I hear tigers and leopards,
I sleep on the water, companion of ducks and gulls.
I am surprised that I've gone to this strange land for nothing, 
I regret parting from like-minded friends.
Ever on my egret prow, time slips away,
the rooster calls out frequently as I toss and turn.
Of high virtue, these hulian vessels,
darkened by shadow, the path to peach and plum.
In the remaining waves I hope to be saved from drying out,
I waste time suffering from a shortage of cash.
For one supported by a cane the gates are remote, 
as for riding a palanquin, my pinions droop.
I feel sad for myself, glad to undertake menial tasks - 
who sympathizes with my efforts to live in seclusion? 
Can the huge ocean lack anything to fish for? - 
there is even a ladder to the floating clouds.
I long to establish some meritorious deed,
whether I speak or am silent, you can see the mark of this.
In giving grain one should point to a silo,
stepping on the bridge, I will surely inscribe the pillar. 
My loyal heart is not broken in old age,
visit me sometime at the creek in Wuling."
114,送司马入京见吴若本,群盗至今日，先朝忝从臣。叹君能恋主，久客羡归秦。黄阁长司谏，丹墀有故人。向来论社稷，为话涕沾巾。,"In Baxi Hearing that the Palace Has Been Retaken, Seeing Assistant Ban Off to the Capital I","I've heard that the ancestral temple has been retaken, 
ringing coach-bells return from Shan.
The whole capital looks on the yellow canopy,
the central palace draws in red gowns. 
Beyond Jian'ge spring skies are far,
in Ba West emissaries with edicts are few.
I think on you, passing through the turmoil of the age,
on a single horse heading toward the royal domain."
115,送司马入京见吴若本,高斋常见野，愁坐更临门。十月山寒重，孤城月水昏。葭萌氐种迥，左担犬戎存。终日忧奔走，归期未敢论。,"
In Baxi Hearing that the Palace Has Been Retaken, Seeing Assistant Ban Off to the Capital II","Bands of marauders have continued to this day, 
in the previous reign I shamed the attendants. 
I sigh that you can so love your ruler,
long a wayfarer, I envy your return to Qin.
In the Yellow Tower I was long in charge of remonstrance, 
in the Cinnabar Court I still have old friends.
I have always considered the Altars of Earth and Grain,
when I talk about them, tears moisten my kerchief."
116,夜闻觱篥,夜闻觱篥沧江上，衰年侧耳情所向。邻舟一听多感伤，塞曲三更欻悲壮。积雪飞霜此夜寒，孤灯急管复风湍。君知天地干戈满，不见江湖行路难。,Hearing the Reed-horn by Night,"By night I heard the reed-horn upon the gray river,
in my waning years I cocked my ears, my feelings drawn to it. 
Once listening to the neighboring boat, I was stirred to much pain,
frontier tunes at midnight, brave melancholy comes suddenly.

From the piled snow and flying frost this night is cold, 
a lone lamp, the shrill pipe, and windblown surge.
You know that all Heaven and Earth are filled with arms,
yet have you not seen ""hard traveling"" upon the river and lakes?"
117,又示两儿,令节成吾老，他时见汝心。浮生看物变，为恨与年深。长葛书难得，江州涕不禁。团圆思弟妹，行坐白头吟。,Another to My Two Sons,"This fine festival completes my old age, 
some day to come will reveal your hearts. 
In this life adrift I watch things change,
the resentment I feel is as deep as my years.
Letters are hard to get from Changge,
as for Jiangzhou, my tears won't be stopped.
I long for reunion with brother and sister,
sitting and walking, a ""Song of White Hair."""
118,元日示宗武,汝啼吾手战，吾笑汝身长。处处逢正月，迢迢滞远方。飘零还柏酒，衰病只藜床。训喻青衿子，名惭白首郎。赋诗犹落笔，献寿更称觞。不见江东弟，高歌泪数行。,"On New Year's Day, for Zongwu","You cry at how my hands tremble with age, 
I smile at how your body grows tall.
We have met the first month in this place and that,
remote, we linger in a faraway land.
As we are swept along, the cypress-needle ale comes again, 
sick and frail, I have only a bed woven of goosefoot.
In teaching I instruct a lad with green lapels,
for reputation, I am ashamed to be a white-haired Director. 
Still I put my brush to paper composing poems,
and once again you offer me a toast to wish me long life. 
I do not see my younger brother in the Southeast,
I sing out loud, with several tracks of tears."
119,舟一有中字出江陵南浦奉寄郑少尹审,更欲投何处，飘然去此都。形骸元土木，舟楫复江湖。社稷缠妖气，干戈送老儒。百年同弃物，万国尽穷途。雨洗平沙静，天衔阔岸纡。鸣螀随泛梗，别燕起秋菰。栖托难高卧，饥寒迫向隅。寂寥相煦沫，浩荡报恩珠。溟涨鲸波动，衡阳雁影徂。南征问悬榻，东逝想乘桴。滥窃商歌听，时忧卞泣诛。经过忆郑驿，斟酌旅情孤。,In My Boat I Set Out From the Southern Bank of Jiangling; Respectfully Sent to the ViceGovernor Zheng Shen,"Where will I put up next?-
I leave this metropolis, swept along.
My form and frame, essentially earth or wood,
boat and oar again on the river and lakes.
Altars of Earth and Grain, entwined by vapors of witchery, 
shield and pike see this old scholar on his way.
Life's hundred years, same as something thrown away,
ten thousand domains, at the end of my road everywhere. 
Rains wash level sands clear,
the heavens swallow the broad shore winding. 
Singing cicadas go with a stick adrift,
departing swallows rise from autumn wild rice. 
Finding brief lodging, it is hard to rest aloof, 
starving and cold, I am forced into the corner. 
In dreary solitude, those who blow froth,
swept through vastness, the pearl that repays kindness.
the oceans flood over, Leviathan waves stir, 
toward Hengyang the outlines of wild geese fare. 
Journeying southward I seek the couch hung up,
going off eastward, I imagine riding the raft.
Rashly I hope that my song in the shang mode will be heeded,
at times I worry about the punishment that made Bian He weep. 
In my passage I recall Zheng's welcome lodges,
pouring ale, you console the loneliness of my feelings of travel."
120,舟月对驿近寺,更深不假烛，月朗自明船。金剎青枫外，朱楼白水边。城乌啼眇眇，野鹭宿娟娟。皓首江湖客，钩帘独未眠。,Moonlight in My Boat Facing a Temple Near the Post Station ,"The hour is late, I do not use a candle,
the moon is radiant, lighting my boat by itself.
Gilded pagoda beyond the green maples,
a vermilion building beside white waters. 
Crows on the city wall caw faint in the distance,
an egret in the wilds spends the night, charming. 
Hoary-headed sojourner on the river and lakes,
hooks up his curtain and alone does not sleep. "
121,舟中,风餐江柳下，雨卧驿楼边。结缆排鱼网，连樯并米船。今朝云细薄，昨夜月清圆。飘泊南庭老，只应学水仙。,In My Boat,"I dine in the wind beneath river willows,
I lie in the rain beside the post station building. 
Tying their moorings, fishing nets line up,
masts in series, rice boats together.
This morning the clouds are wispy and thin, 
last night the moon was clear and round.
Tossed drifting along, I grow old in southern lands,
I should just study to become a river immortal."
122,次晚洲,参错云石稠，坡陁风涛壮。晚洲适知名，秀色固异状。棹经垂猿把，身在度鸟上。摆浪散帙妨，危沙折花当。羁离暂愉悦，羸老反惆怅。中原未解兵，吾得终疏放。,Reaching Wan Isle,"All mixed together, rock and cloud are thick, 
heaving and crashing, wind-blown billows strong.
I just learned the name of Wan Isle,
its splendid beauty is indeed of a different form. 
Our oars pass the grasp of hanging gibbons,
our bodies are above the birds crossing the sky. 
Tossing waves, opening my books prevented,
insecure sands, for snapping flowers just right. 
On travels away from home, short-lived delights, 
feeble and old, it turns instead to depression. 
Arms have not ceased on the Central Plain,
can I finally get to feel relaxed ease?"
123,官亭夕坐戏简颜十少府,南国调寒杵，西江浸日车。客愁连蟋蟀，亭古带蒹葭。不返青丝鞚，虚烧夜烛花。老翁须地主，细细酌流霞。,Sitting in the Official Pavilion in the Evening: A Playful Note to Sheriff Yan,"The southern lands, cold-weather pestles in harmony, 
West River soaks the sun carriage.
The wayfarer's melancholy is linked to the crickets,
the pavilion is ancient, lined by reeds and rushes 
Your blue silk reins have not turned back here, 
the night candle's flame burns for nothing.
this old man awaits the host
to pour out fine streams of drifting auroras."
124,归梦,道路时通塞，江山日寂寥。偷生唯一老，伐叛已三朝。雨急青枫暮，云深黑水遥。梦归归未得，不用楚辞招。,Dream of Return,"The road is sometimes open, sometimes blocked, 
rivers and mountains grow more dreary day to day. 
Saving my life, just one old man,
already three reigns attacking the rebels.
The rain drives hard, twilight of Greenmaple, 
clouds deep, Blackwaters far.
I dream of return, but have not returned,
no use that the Lyrics of Chu summon me."
125,湖中送敬十使君适广陵,相见各头白，其如离别何。几年一会面，今日复悲歌。少壮乐难得，岁寒心匪他。气缠霜匣满，冰置玉壶多。遭乱实漂泊，济时曾琢磨。形容吾校老，胆力尔谁过？秋晚岳增翠，风高湖涌波。骞腾访知己，淮海莫蹉跎。,On the Lake Seeing Off Prefect Jing On His Way to Guangling ,"When we meet, each of us is white-haired,
but separation can't be helped.
In how many years do we meet even once? -
today I sing out sadly again.
Hard to again find joys of youth and one's prime, 
in the cold of the year our hearts are as brothers. 
The aura surrounding the frosty sword-case is full,
the ice is much, set in a pot of jade.
Meeting upheavals, I have been tossed along indeed, 
you have honed yourself to rescue the age.
In appearance I look the older,
in force of courage who can surpass you?
Autumn is late, the great mountains here increase their green, 
the wind is high, waves surge on the lake.
Mounting into flight, you will visit friends,
on the seas and the Huai let not time slip past."
126,南征,春岸桃花水，云帆枫树林。偷生长避地，适远更沾襟。老病南征日，君恩北望心。百年歌自苦，未见有知音。,Journeying South,"Spring shores, waters of peach blossoms, 
cloud-like sail, forests of maple trees.
Saving my life, ever seeking a refuge,
I go off far, again soaking my gown with tears. 
Old and sick, days of journeying south,
my ruler's grace, a heart that gazes north. 
Life's hundred years, singing of my suffering,
I have never seen a true understanding friend."
127,宿白沙驿·初过湖南五里,水宿仍余照，人烟复此亭。驿边沙旧白，湖外草新青。万象皆春气，孤槎自客星。随波无限月，的的近南溟。,Staying Over at White Sands Post Station,"I spend nights on the water, now still in last sunshine, 
the smoke of men's dwellings, and then this pavilion. 
Beside the station, sands white as before,
beyond the lake, the grass turns fresh green.
The million images-all springtime's vapor;  
on a lone raft, I myself am the wandering star.
Along with the waves, the moonlight boundless,
and on its sparkling I draw near to the Southern Deeps."
128,宿青草湖,洞庭犹在目，青草续为名。宿桨依农事，邮签报水程。寒冰争倚薄，云月递微明。湖雁双双起，人来故北征。,Spending the Night on Green Grass Lake ,"Lake Dongting is still in my eyes,
""Green Grass"" is its name as we continue on.
Overnight oars beside farming work,
the post station notice tells the stages of the water journey.
Cold ice floes compete to draw near, 
cloudy moon alternately faint then bright.
Lake geese rise in pair after pair,
when someone comes, on purpose they fare on north."
129,宴王使君宅题二首（其二）,泛爱容霜发，留欢卜夜闲。自吟诗送老，相劝酒开颜。戎马今何地，乡园独旧山。江湖堕清月，酩酊任扶还。,"
Written on a Feast at Governor Wang's Residence II","With your general affection, you accept one with frosty hair, 
making me stay for pleasure, you bar the gate by night.
I myself chant poems to go along with me through old age,
at your urging, ale makes me smile.
Warhorses are now everywhere,
in your native garden, alone at your former hill. 
On the rivers and lakes clear moonlight sinks,
you have someone help me back, completely drunk."
130,宴王使君宅题二首（其一）,汉主追韩信，苍生起谢安。吾徒自漂泊，世事各艰难。逆旅招邀近，他乡思绪宽。不才甘朽质，高卧岂泥蟠。,Written on a Feast at Governor Wang's Residence I,"Han's ruler went after Han Xin,
the common folk roused Xie An.
My sort is just tossed along,
the situation of the age brings hardship to each. 
My lodgings were close for your invitation,
in a strange land my broodings are eased. 
Lacking talent, I accept my decayed condition,
my resting aloof is no coiling in the mud."
131,江南逢李龟年,岐王宅里寻常见，崔九堂前几度闻。正是江南好风景，落花时节又逢君。,Meeting Li Guinian in Jiangnan,"In the lodgings of the Prince of Qi I saw you commonly,
at the head of the hall of Cui Nine I heard you many times. 
It's really true that in Jiangnan the scenery is fine,
and in the season of falling flowers I meet you once again."
132,老病,老病巫山里，稽留楚客中。药残他日裹，花发去年丛。夜足沾沙雨，春多逆水风。合分双赐笔，犹作一飘蓬。,Old and Sick,"Old and sick in the Wu Gorges, 
staying on, a sojourner in Chu.
Some medicine remains in wrappers from other days,
flowers bloom from last year's clumps. 
Night brings plenty of sand-wetting rain, 
spring has much wind against the current.
I should leave aside my pair of presented brushes,
I am still one wind-tossed dandelion puff."
